      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.18.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.18 introduces serious
        index formats changes, and it will be advisable to reset the index
        in most cases. <em>IF</em> the 1.18 index is not configured for
        case and diacritics sensitivity, it is mostly compatible with
        1.17 indexes though. Case/diacritics sensitivity can be turned
        off either by a compile flag or a configuration variable, and
        the default is still a stripped index (so, mostly compatible
        with 1.17). If you activate case and diacritics sensitivity,
        you must reset the index.</p>

      <p>Always reset the index if installing over an older version (1.14
        and older). The simplest way to do this is to quit all recoll
        programs and just delete the index directory (<span
        class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then
        start recoll or recollindex.  <span
        class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span> will do the same in most
        cases.</p>

      <p>Some new, auxiliary, features also require a full reindex:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The file size filtering functions if the existing index was
        created by version 1.16 or older.</li>
        <li>The anchored search feature if the index was created by
          release 1.15 or older.</li>
      </ul>



      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.18 has some major changes, the most visible of
        which is the ability to search for exact matches of character case
        and diacritics.</p> 

      <p>Recoll 1.18.0 changes:</p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>The index can now be configured for case and diacritics
          sensitivity, in which case raw terms are indexed. On such an
          index, search insensitivity to case and diacriics is obtained,
          when desired, by query time expansion, in a similar manner to
          what is used for stemming. See the 
          <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
            manual chapter for details</a> about controlling the
            feature.</li> 

        <li>Recoll has a new capacity to store page break locations
          and use them when opening a document at the location for a
          given match. This currently works with PDF, Postscript and DVI
          documents, and the <b>evince</b> viewer.</li> 

        <li>Recoll can now also pass a search string to the native
          application.</li> 

        <li>The GUI result list has a new "snippets" window for
          documents with page numbers, which let the user choose a
          snippet and open the document at the appropriate page.</li>

        <li>We now allow multiple directory specifications in the query
          language, as in: <i>dir:/home/me -dir:tmp</i></li>

        <li>The search inside the GUI preview window, has been
          improved, and allows selecting from a list one of the
          initial term groups as the search target.</li>

        <li>A new script dedicated to laptops, which can start or stop
          recollindex according to mains power status.</li>

        <li>Added &lt;pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"&gt; to plain
          text HTML display options. This will often be the best
          option to display plain text: it will better respect
          indentation, while folding long lines.</li>

        <li>When running in an UTF-8 locale, and after decoding a
          plain text file as UTF-8 fails, indexing will try again
          using an 8bit character set heuristically chosen according
          to the locale country code.</li>

        <li>A new configuration, maxmemberkbs, has been implemented to
          limit the size of archive members we process. This will avoid
          recoll trying to read a 4 GB ISO from a zip archive...</li>

        <li>Proper error reporting when a wildcard expansion is
          truncated for size. An incomplete search could previously be
          performed without any indication.</li>

        <li>More effort is also put in choosing the terms used in
          generating the snippets inside the result list.</li>

        <li>Recoll now uses the Xapian "synonyms" mechanism to store all
          data about stemming, case, and diacritics expansion (this
          replaces the previous ad-hoc stemming expansion
          mechanism).</li>

        <li>Partial autodetection of thunderbird mailboxes found out
          of the configured location.</li>

        <li>Implemented a list of mime types that should be opened
          with the locally configured application even when <em>Use
            Desktop Preferences</em> is checked. This will permit, for
          example, using evince for its page access capabilities on
          PDF files, while letting the desktop handle all the other
          mime types.</li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>The unac_except_trans mechanism could be buggy in some
              cases and generate wrong character translations.</li>
            <li>Don't terminate monitor for permissions-related
              addwatch error.</li>
            <li>Fix handling of ODF documents exported by Google
              docs.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
