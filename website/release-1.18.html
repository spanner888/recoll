      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.18.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.18 introduces serious
        index formats changes, and it will be advisable to reset the
        index in most cases. IF the 1.18 index is not configured for
        case and diacritics sensitivity, it is mostly compatible with
        1.17 indexes though. Case/diacritics sensitivity can be turned
        off either by a compile flag or a configuration variable, and
        the default is still a stripped index (so, mostly compatible
        with 1.17). If you activate case and diacritics sensitivity,
        you must reset the index.</p>

      <p>Always reset the index if installing over an older version (1.14
        and older). The simplest way to do this is to quit all recoll
        programs and just delete the index directory (<span
        class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then
        start recoll or recollindex.  <span
        class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span> will do the same in most
        cases.</p>

      <p>Some new, auxiliary, features do require a full reindex to work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The file size filtering functions (for an index created by
          1.16 or older).</li>
        <li>The anchored search feature if the index was created by
          release 1.15 or older.</li>
      </ul>



      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.18 has some major changes 1.17, the most visible of
        which is the ability to consider character case and diacritics
        when searching.</p> 

      <p>Recoll 1.18.0 changes:</p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>The index can now be configured for case and diacritics
          sensitivity. Raw terms are indexed, and query time expansions
          are used when search insensitivity is designed (in a similar
          manner to what is used for stemming). See the chapter
          manual for details about controlling the feature.</li>

        <li>More effort is put in choosing the terms used in
          generating the snippets inside the result list.</li>
        
        <li>Capacity to store page breaks and use them when opening a
          document.</li> 
        <li>Capacity to pass a search string to the native app.</li>
        <li>New "snippets" window for documents with page numbers, let
          the user choose a snippet and open the document at the
          appropriate page.</li>
        <li>We now use the Xapian "synonyms" mechanism to store all
          data about stemming, case, and diacritics expansion (this
          replace the previous ad-hoc stemming expansion mechanism).</li>

        <li>New script to start/stop recollindex according to mains
          power status.</li>
        <li>Add &lt;pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"&gt; to plain
          text HTML display options.</li>
        <li>Allow multiple directory specifications in the query
          language, as in: <i>dir:/home/me -dir:tmp</i></li>
        <li>Improved search in the preview window, allows selecting
          one of the initial search clauses from a list.</li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>The unac_except_trans mechanism could be buggy in some
              cases and generate wrong character translations.</li>
            <li>Don't terminate monitor for permissions-related
              addwatch error.</li>
            <li>Fix handling of ODF documents exported by Google
              docs.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
