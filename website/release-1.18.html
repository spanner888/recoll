      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.18.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.18 introduces serious
        index formats changes, and it will be advisable to reset the index
        in most cases. This will be best done by destroying the
        index directory (<tt>rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</tt>).</p> 

      <p><em>If</em> the 1.18 index is not configured for case and
        diacritics sensitivity, it is mostly compatible with 1.17
        indexes though.</p>  

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. For 1.18, it can be
        turned on only by editing recoll.conf by hand (see the
        manual). If you do so, you must reset the index.</p>

      <p>Always reset the index if installing over an older version (1.16
        and older). The simplest way to do this is to quit all recoll
        programs and just delete the index directory (<span
        class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then
        start recoll or recollindex.  <span
        class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span> will do the same in
        most, but not all, cases.</p>

      <p>The subdirectories of xapiandb which were previously used to
        store the stem expansion database (stem_english,
        stem_french...)  are not used anymore, because the data is now
        stored in the Xapian synonyms table. They will stay around if
        you do nothing about them, so you may want to delete them if
        you have not chosen to just delete the whole index
        directory.</p>

      <p><em>Viewer exceptions</em>: 
        There is a new list of mime types that should be opened with
        the locally configured application even when <em>Use
          Desktop Preferences</em> is checked. This allows making
        use of new function (direct access to page), which could
        not be available through the desktop's <tt>xdg-open</tt>.
        The default list contains PDF,
        Postscript and DVI, so you may want to reset it after
        installation if you want to keep the previous behaviour
        (losing the page number functionality). This can be done
        from the <em>Preferences->Gui Configuration</em> menu.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.18 has some major changes, the most visible of
        which is the ability to search for exact matches of character case
        and diacritics.</p> 

      <p>Recoll 1.18.0 changes:</p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>The index can now be configured for case and diacritics
          sensitivity, in which case raw terms are indexed. On such an
          index, search insensitivity to case and diacriics is obtained,
          when desired, by query time expansion, in a similar manner to
          what is used for stemming. See the 
          <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
            manual chapter for details</a> about controlling the
          feature. The capacity for case/diacritics sensitivity is
          off by default, and you should not see differences in this
          respect after upgrading if you do not turn it on
          explicitely. Even on a raw index, most searches should
          behave like they did in 1.17. Sensitivity must be
          explicitely requested in most cases.</li>

        <li>Recoll has a new capacity to store page break locations
          and use them when opening a document at the location for a
          given match. This currently works with PDF, Postscript and DVI
          documents, and the <b>evince</b> viewer.</li> 

        <li>Recoll can now also pass a search string to the native
          application.</li> 

        <li>There is a list of mime types that should be opened with
          the locally configured application even when <em>Use
            Desktop Preferences</em> is checked. This will permit, for
          example, using evince for its page access capabilities on
          PDF files, while letting the desktop handle all the other
          mime types. The list is not empty by default, it contains PDF,
          Postscript and DVI, so you may want to reset it after
          installation if you want to keep the previous behaviour
          (losing the page number functionality). This can be done
          from the <em>Preferences->Gui Configuration</em> menu.</li>

        <li>The GUI result list has a new "snippets" window for
          documents with page numbers, which let the user choose a
          snippet and open the document at the appropriate page.</li>

        <li>The advanced search screen now has a history
          function. While the focus is in this window, you
          can walk the history of searches using the up and down arrows.</li>

        <li>We now allow multiple directory specifications in the query
          language, as in: <i>dir:/home/me -dir:tmp</i></li>

        <li>The search inside the GUI preview window, has been
          improved, and allows selecting from a list one of the
          initial term groups as the search target.</li>

        <li>A new script dedicated to laptops, which can start or stop
          recollindex according to mains power status.</li>

        <li>Added &lt;pre style="white-space: pre-wrap"&gt; to plain
          text HTML display options. This will often be the best
          option to display plain text: it will better respect
          indentation, while folding long lines.</li>

        <li>When running in an UTF-8 locale, and after failing to decode a
          plain text file as UTF-8, indexing will try again using an 8 bit
          character set heuristically chosen according to the locale
          country code.</li>

        <li>A new configuration variable, <tt>maxmemberkbs</tt>, has been
          implemented to limit the size of archive members we process. This
          will avoid trying to read a 4 GB ISO from a zip archive as
          happened in the past...</li>

        <li>Proper error reporting when a wildcard expansion is
          truncated for size. An incomplete search could previously be
          performed without any indication.</li>

        <li>More effort is also put in choosing the terms used in
          generating the snippets inside the result list.</li>

        <li>Recoll now uses the Xapian "synonyms" mechanism to store all
          data about stemming, case, and diacritics expansion (this
          replaces the previous ad-hoc stemming expansion
          mechanism).</li>

        <li>Partial autodetection of thunderbird mailboxes found out
          of the configured location.</li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>The unac_except_trans mechanism could be buggy in some
              cases and generate wrong character translations.</li>
            <li>Don't terminate monitor for permissions-related
              addwatch error.</li>
            <li>Fix handling of ODF documents exported by Google
              docs.</li>
            <li>It was previously impossible to open the parent of an
              embedded document (e.g. the CHM file for an HTML page
              inside the CHM) if the parent was itself a member of an
              archive.</li> 
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
