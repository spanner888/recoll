      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.22.x</h1>
      
      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 </p>

      <p>1.20-22 indexes are fully compatible. Installing 1.22
        over an 1.19 index is possible, but there have been small
        changes in the way compound words (e.g. email addresses) are
        indexed, so it will be best to reset the index. Still, in a
        pinch, 1.22 search can mostly use an 1.19 index. </p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (you're not sure it's at least 1.18). The best method
        is to quit all Recoll programs and delete the index directory 
        (<span class="literal">
          rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then start <code>recoll</code>
        or <code>recollindex</code>. <br> 

        <span class="literal">recollindex -z</span> will do the same
        in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. It can be
        turned on <em>only</em> by editing
        recoll.conf (
        <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the
        index.</p> 

      <h2>Changes in Recoll 1.22.0</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>The main "feature" in recoll 1.22 is that it has
          a <a href="pages/recoll-windows.html">Microsoft Windows
            version</a>. This is has been tested on Windows 7 and 
          Windows 10, and it works mostly like the Unix version, with
          the notable exceptions that it has no real-time mode (need to
          start indexing by hand from the GUI, or arrange something with
          the command-line recollindex.exe). Also there are a few very
          Unix-y file types which are not processed on Windows, and the
          indexer is single-threaded.</li>

        <li>Synonyms: users can define term synonyms groups in
          ordinary text files. They are used only at query times to
          expand a query to synonym terms.
          <a href="http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/webhelp/docs/RCL.SEARCH.SYNONYMS.html">
            More details</a>.</li>
        
        <li>Most input handlers are now compatible with
          Python3. Actually the only ones which are not are kept back by
          the library they use. Also most external handlers are now
          persistent, and quite a few shell-script have been converted
          to Python for use on Windows.</li> 

        <li>The build system has been converted to use the autotools in
          a fairly standard way. The Windows build is based on Qt
          Creator and MinGW.</li>

        <li>Make dehyphenation (co-worker->coworker in addition to the
          normal terms) optional, active by default.</li>

        <li>For people using the Firefox web page indexer add-on: a
          new tool in the GUI to list and delete entries from the Web
          cache.</li>
      
        <li>Improved index statistics in the GUI, and improved display
          while the indexer is working.</li>
        
      </ul>
