      <h1><a name="translation">Translation</a></h1>

      <p>More translations is good ! If you are a non-english speaker
	(and understand english, which can probably be assumed, you
	being reading this), you can take a little time to translate
	the GUI messages file.</p>
      <p>The newest versions of the message files follow. There
	is an empty one (the xx thing), the others are partially
	translated, just needing an update for the new messages.<p>
      <p>Updating the files can easily be done with
	the <span class="application">Qt Linguist</span>. Contact me
	for more directions if needed.</p>

      <h1><a name="development">Development</a></h1>

      <p>The Recoll source repository is
	on <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll">Bitbucket</a>. Using
	Mercurial, you're 2 commands away from cloning it and
	hacking away.</p>
      
      <p>Apart from the many tasks inside the
      <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/issues">issue
	tracking system</a>, these are the general areas where help or
	ideas are particularly welcome:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A better GUI design (both the ergonomy and the appearance).</li>

        <li>More support for the more advanced <span class=
	    "application">Xapian</span> concepts like relevance
	  feedback.</li>

        <li>More filters for less common or less obviously
	  useful file types.</li>

        <li>Integration with the <span class="application">KDE</span> 
	  desktop.</li>

	<li>Integration with some mail user agent. We need a way to
	  jump from a message preview to the message in thread context
	  inside the MUA.</li>

	<li>Etc. :)</li>
      </ul>

      <h1><a name="problemreport">Problem reporting</a></h1>

      <p>Once in a while it will happen that a Recoll program will
	crash (either the "recoll" graphical interface or the
	"recollindex" command line indexing command).</p>

      <p>Reporting crashes is very useful. It can help others, and it
	can get your own problem to be solved.</p>

      <p>All reports are useful. But, in order to maximize usefulness,
	a crash report should include a so-called stack trace, something
	that indicates what the program was doing when it
	crashed. Getting a useful stack trace is not very difficult,
	but it may need a little work on your part (which
	will then enable me do my part of the work).</p>

      <p>If your distribution includes a separate package for Recoll
	debugging symbols, it probably also has a page on its web site
	explaining how to use them to get a stack trace. You should
	follow these instructions. If there is no debugging package,
	you should follow the instructions below. A little
	familiarity with the command line will be necessary.</p>

      <dl><dt>Compiling and installing a debugging version</dt>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Obtain the recoll source for the version you are using
	    (<a
	    href="http://www.recoll.org/download.html">www.recoll.org</a>),
	    and extract the source tree.</li>

	  <li>Follow the instructions for 
	    <a
	    href="http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/index.html#RCL.INSTALL.BUILDING">
	      building Recoll from source</a> with the following
	      modifications: 
	    <ul>
	      <li>Before running <tt>configure</tt>, edit
		the <tt>mk/localdefs.in</tt> file and remove the <tt>-O2</tt>
		option(s). </li>
	      <li>When running <tt>configure</tt>, specify the
		standard installation location for your system as a prefix
		(to avoid ending up with two installed versions, which
		would almost certainly end in confusion). On Linux this
		would typically be: 
		<br><tt>configure --prefix=/usr</tt>.
	      </li> <li>When installing, arrange for the installed
		executables not to be stripped of debugging symbols by
		specifying a value for the STRIP environment variable
		(ie: <tt>echo</tt> or <tt>ls</tt>): <br><tt>sudo make
		install STRIP=ls</tt>
	      </li>
	    </ul>
      </ul></dd>

      <dt>Getting a core dump</dt>
	<dd>You will need to run the operation that caused the crash
	inside a writable directory, and tell the system that you
	accept core dumps. The commands need to be run in a shell
	inside a terminal window. Ie:
	  <pre><tt>
cd
ulimit -c unlimited
recoll  #(or recollindex or whatever you want to run).
	  </tt></pre>

	  Hopefully, you will succeed in getting the command to crash,
	  and you will get a core file.
	</dd>

      <dt>Using gdb to get a stack trace</dt>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Install <tt>gdb</tt> if it is not already on the system.</li>

	    <li>Run <tt>gdb</tt> on the command that crashed and the
	    core file (depending on the system, the core file may be
	    named "core" or something else, like recollindex.core, or
	    core.pid), ie:

	      <br><tt>gdb /usr/bin/recollindex core</tt>
	    </li>
	    <li>Inside <tt>gdb</tt>,  you need to use different
	      commands to get a stack trace for <tt>recoll</tt>
	      and <tt>recollindex</tt>. For <tt>recollindex</tt> you
	      can use the <tt>bt</tt> command. For <tt>recoll</tt>
	      use: <br><tt>thread&nbsp;apply&nbsp;all&nbsp;bt&nbsp;full</tt>
	    </li>
	    <li>Copy/paste the output to your report email :), and
	      quit <tt>gdb</tt> ("q").</li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>
      </dl>
