      <h1>Contributing to Recoll developement and availability</h1>
      
      <p>If you are not a software developer, or have no time
      available for testing the application of thinking about how it
      could be improved, there is always the possibility of
      contributing a donation, which will be much appreciated !<br/>
      <a href="/donations/index.html">
        <img src="/donations/btn_donate_LG.gif" /></a>
      </p>
        
      <p>If you wish to become involved in the development of <span
	  class="application">Recoll</span>, please send me an <a
	  href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">email</a>.</p> 

      <h1><a name="translation">Translation</a></h1>

      <p>More translations is good ! If you are a non-english speaker
	(and understand english, which can probably be assumed, you
	being reading this), you can take a little time to translate
	the GUI messages file.</p>
      <p>The newest versions of the message files follow can be found
        in <a href="translations">this directory</a>. There
	is an empty one (the xx one), the others are partially
	translated, just needing an update for the new messages.<p>
      <p>Updating the files can easily be done with
	the <span class="application">Qt Linguist</span>. Contact me
	for more directions if needed.</p>

      <h1><a name="development">Development</a></h1>

      <p>The Recoll source repository is
	on <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll">Bitbucket</a>. Using
	Mercurial, you're 2 commands away from cloning it and
	hacking away.</p>
      
      <p>Apart from the many tasks inside the
      <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/issues">issue
	tracking system</a>, these are the general areas where help or
	ideas are particularly welcome:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A better GUI design (both the ergonomy and the
	appearance). Adding missing shortcuts or fixing the menu
	accelerators for exemple is easy and useful.</li>

        <li>More support for the more advanced <span class=
	    "application">Xapian</span> concepts like relevance
	  feedback.</li>

        <li>More filters for less common or less obviously
	  useful file types.</li>

        <li>Integration with the <span class="application">KDE</span> 
	  desktop.</li>

	<li>Integration with some mail user agent. We need a way to
	  jump from a message preview to the message in thread context
	  inside the MUA.</li>

	<li>Etc. :)</li>
      </ul>

      <h1><a name="problemreport">Problem reporting</a></h1>

      <p>Once in a while it will happen that a Recoll program will
	crash (either the "recoll" graphical interface or the
	"recollindex" command line indexing command).</p>

      <p>Reporting crashes is very useful. It can help others, and it
	can get your own problem to be solved.</p>

      <p>You will find help and information about producing a useful
      problem report on this 
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/ProblemSolvingData">
          Recoll wiki page</a>.</p>
