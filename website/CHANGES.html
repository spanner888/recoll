       </p>

      <h2><a name="1.14.3">1.14.3</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Get rid of permanent filter subprocess at the end of a GUI
          indexing pass.</li>
        <li>Add new filter for indexing GNU info files.</li>
        <li>Index the file name from a zip or chm internal path.</li>
        <li>Add hotrecoll.py script to help with one-key recoll
          activation/hiding. Move focus to search entry when unminimized.</li> 
        <li>Handle bad mbox format from Thunderbird.</li>
        <li>Catch exception which was causing stderr messages while
          indexing encrypted zip files.</li>
        <li>Change result list "Edit" links to "Open" for consistency
          with menus.</li>
        <li>Change the type of character set conversion occurring
          when using  "Copy file path" from the result list. 
          Should work in more cases than the previous approach (but
          will still fail sometimes).</li>
        <li>Update lyx filter.</li>
        <li>Fix problems with white space in file name in several
          input filters.</li>
        <li>Support mutagen versions older than 1.17.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.14.2">1.14.2</a></h2>
      <p>Note: most of the changes are in release 1.14.0. Release 1.14.1 fixed 2
	bugs. Release 1.14.2 fixes the help browser which was broken
	by 1.14.2. Sigh ...</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.SEARCH.LANG">
	    date selection in queries</a>.</li>
	<li>Pure negative queries (ie: <i>-someterm date:P10D/</i>.</li>
	<li>Autosuffs: option to automatically turn words into <tt>ext:</tt>
	  clauses (ie: <i>xls</i> -> <i>ext:xls</i>) (GUI preferences
	  panel).</li> 
	<li>Allow extracting arbitrary mail headers and use them as
	  index/search fields (configured in the <tt>fields</tt>
	  file).</li>
	<li><tt>nonumbers</tt> configuration parameter: disable
	  indexing of all numbers, useful for some data files with lots
	  of numerical data.</li>
	<li>Shortcuts for the results page: <tt>PageUp/Down</tt> can
	  be used even when the focus is in the search
	  entry. <tt>Shift+Home</tt>: back to first page of results.
	  <tt>Ctrl+Shift+s</tt>: return focus to the search
	  entry. </li>
	<li>Add full screen mode for small devices.</li>
	<li>Added -i option to recollq to specify extra indexes.</li>
	<li>Removed use of id3lib for extracting mp3 tags. A Python filter
 	  based on mutagen now handles all audio formats
 	  (mp3/flac/ogg). <i>If you are currently indexing audio
 	  files, you need to install mutagen, Recoll will not use
 	    id3lib or the Flac/Ogg tools any more</i>. </li>
	<li>Filter for <b>fictionbook</b> (.fb2) documents.</li>
	<li>Cleaned up the Python samples and made recollq.py a usable
	  clone of recollq.</li>
	<li>Errors when opening additional indexes for a query are now
	  fatal. They could easily go unnoticed before.</li>
	<li>Proper LARGEFILE support.</li>
	<li>Use <b>xsltproc</b> instead of misc dirty tricks to
	  extract text from most current XML-based documents (except
	  those in which the XML is too broken).</li>
	<li>Implement <tt>configure --enable-pic</tt> and use it for
	  the KIO slave and Python and PHP modules.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Bugs also fixed in the 1.13 branch:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The <tt>filename</tt> (transcoded file name) field
	    could not be stored, so it could not be displayed in the
	    result list. Can now be displayed as %(filename).</li> 
	<li>Html files would always be indexed even when filtered
	    out by <tt>indexedmimetypes</tt></li>
	<li>Preview: toggling between main text and metadata
	    display would confuse the text format.</li>
	<li>Restore <tt>indexallfilenames=0</tt> functionality.</li>
      </ul>

	<h2><a name="1.13.04">1.13.04</a></h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Provide a set of configuration defaults so that compilation has a
            chance to succeed on unknown systems.</li>
	  <li>Install icon to the pixmaps directory.</li>
	  <li>Fixes stemming, which was broken for all previous 1.13
	    releases.</li>
	  <li><a href="BUGS.html#b_1_13_02">Bugs fixed between 1.13.02
	      and 1.13.04.</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1.13.02">1.13.02</a></h2>
	<ul><li>This version has a single fix to work around a problem in the
            Qt 4.6.1 uic utility. If you are not using Qt 4.6.1 and are
            currently running Recoll 1.13.01, you do not need to
            upgrade.</li></ul>

	<h2><a name="1.13.01">1.13.01</a></h2>

	<ul>
	  <li>Recoll has a new class of persistent external filters
            with the capability to process several documents, or
            multi-document files, in the same instance. Benefits: much
            faster image tag indexing, and new file formats. Except for
            the Perl image tag filter (because of ExifTool), the new
            filters are written in Python.<li>

	  <li>New file formats: chm (microsoft help), zip archives, .ics
	    calendar files. Individual pages in chm files are indexed and
	    can be previewed. Zip is quite convenient for maildir
	    archives (for example).</li>

	  <li>Recoll can now use the output of the Beagle Firefox plugin
	    to index visited web pages and bookmarks. This is only usable
	    if Beagle itself is not running, else Recoll and Beagle will be
	    fighting for the same queue.</li>

	  <li>Big text files (like application logs) can now be paged for
            indexing, avoiding excess memory usage during indexing and
            improving the usability at query time. They can also be
            altogether skipped by setting a maximum size configuration
            parameter. These parameters have default values (1 MB and 20
            MB) which change Recoll behaviour compared to previous
            versions. You can set <i>textfilepagekbs</i>
            and <i>textfilemaxmbs</i> to -1 in the configuration to
            restore the old behaviour.</li>

	  <li>A cache was implemented for mbox message header offsets. This
	    speeds up message previews for big mbox files.</li>

	  <li>Miscellaneous usability improvements: 
	    <ul>
	      <li>Allow using page-up/down and shift-home to scroll the
		result list while the focus is in the search entry. </li>
	      <li>Make 'Use desktop preferences' the default for new
		Recoll installations, and make this choice more
		prominent in the external viewer dialog.</li> 
	      <li>^P starts the print dialog on a preview window.</li>
	      <li>If a search has no result, alternate spellings are
		suggested. This feature is still a bit raw and will be
		improved.</li> 
	      <li>If the text of a document is empty, preview will switch to
		displaying the document fields.</li>
	      <li>New entry in the result list contextual menu for opening
		the parent document of a result list hit with its native
		application. Useful for exemple for pages inside chm files.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>Indentation is now preserved when displaying text documents
	    inside the preview window. This is particularly welcome for
	    program source files.</li>

	  <li>Allow substituting arbitrary fields in the result
            paragraph, using a %(fieldname) syntax</li>

	  <li>The real-time indexing monitor will now accumulate
	    modifications during 30&nbsp;S before indexing.</li>

	  <li>The indexer can now split camelCase words, allowing search on
	    component terms. This is not enabled by default as it can
	    confuse phrase searches (ie: "MySQL&nbsp;manual" is matched by
	    phrase queries for "my&nbsp;sql&nbsp;manual" and "MySQL&nbsp;manual"
	    but not "mysql&nbsp;manual"). Use "configure&nbsp;--enable-camelcase"
	    to activate it.
	  </li>

	  <li>The ipath is now printed by default after the url in the
	    default result list format.</li>
	  
	  <li><i>recoll_noindex</i> and <i>skippedNames</i> can now be
	    changed at any point in the tree (only for topdirs previously).</li>

	  <li>Allow using location/application sensitivity in external viewer
            choice. This uses several new functions: 
            <ul>
              <li>Allow the substitution of arbitrary document fields inside
		external viewer command line arguments.</li>
              <li>Allow field values to be set on all documents
		in a file system subtree. For example, you can 
		set an application tag (ie: rclaptg = gnus) on all mailbox
		files under a specific directory.</li>
              <li>New syntax in mimeview for including the rclaptg field in
		viewer choice
		(<i>mimetype</i>|<i>tagvalue</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;...).</li> 
            </ul>
	  </li>

	  <li>Allow specifiying a specific default character set for mail
	    messages. This is mainly useful for readpst dumps. All
	    reasonable non-ascii messages specify their character set.</li>

	  <li>Added a --without-gui configure option. Removes all X11 and
	    Qt dependancies and only compiles the command-line interface.</li>

	  <li>Improved the kio_recoll build. There is no need to run
	    configure manually in the main directory any more. Ubuntu
	    packages for kio_recoll are now built on the
	    <a href="http://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/ppa">
	      recoll-backports PPA on launchpad.net</a>.</li>

	</ul>


	<h2><a name="1.12.4">1.12.4</a></h2>
	<p>Bugs fixed:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Qt4 version only: the search inside the preview window
	    could become unbearably slow for big documents (quadratically
	    so), and could not be interrupted (Qt bug). The Qt3 version of
	    the code was included in the preview tool to restore good
	    performance. This bug is the main reason for this release.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Build system improvements:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Perform minimal base package configuration inside the kio
	    cmake code to permit building it from scratch (without a build
	    of the main code). Mainly useful for builds on the Ubuntu
	    PPA.</li>
	  <li>Implement a --without-gui option to build a pure
	    command-line version with no Qt or X11 dependancies.</li>
	  <li>Ensure that the user's PATH settings determine where we
	    look first for qmake in all cases.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1.12.3">1.12.3</a></h2>
	<p>This is a bug fix release.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Fix the sort tool which had been broken since 1.11  with
            some (or all?) qt3 versions.<li>
	  <li>Catch two Xapian exceptions which could crash the GUI when a query
            was run while the index was being updated.</li>
	  <li>Ensure that the result list right-click pop up menu will appear even
            when the click is inside a table.</li>
	  <li>Fix the way we retrieve the Xapian library version to avoid
            GUI compilation problems.</li>
	  <li>Inside the real-time indexer: only use the main thread to test that
            the X11 server is still alive. Multithreaded calls to x11IsAlive()
            would sometimes crash the process because of an X11 error.</li>
	  <li>Define filter timeout so that a looping filter (ie: rclps trying to
            index loop.ps) will not completely stop the indexing. Default value:
            20mn. Add loop.ps to skippedNames.</li>
	  <li>Improve filter subprocesses management. Some could previously be
            left around after recollindex was killed. Improve cancellation
            request acknowledgment by recollindex (two ^C were sometimes
            necessary to make it terminate).</li>
	  <li>Signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are now blocked in addition to
	    INTR/TERM/QUIT.</li>
	  <li>Extended attributes indexing now works for all file types.</li>
	  <li>Ensure that queries started from the command line are handled as
            normal ones (they previously could not be sorted).</li>
	  <li>Improve man page indexing: do not index section header terms.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2><a name="1.12.1">1.12.1</a></h2>
	<p>This is a very minor release, mainly to fix compilation
          issues and a few very minor bugs. No need to upgrade if
          you don't experience these.</p>
	<ul>
          <li>Fixed compilation errors for new gcc and gnu libc.</li>
          <li>Use groff html output in rclman to get rid of control
            characters in output (improve manual pages indexing). Fix
            8bit character issues in file names in rcllyx.</li>
          <li>Fixed command line arguments processing problem with 
            "recoll -q"</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1.12.0">1.12.0</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li>Recoll now implements a KIO slave to allow searching
            directly from KDE applications. This does not affect the
            main application and is not enabled by default (go to the
            kde/kio/recoll source directory for build
            instructions). </li>
          <li>Recoll now computes md5 checksums for all indexed
            documents and optionally collapses duplicate entries inside
            the result list. This needs a full reindex to become
            effective for older documents already in the index. The
            option to activate collapsing is in the <i>Query
              Configuration</i>.</li>
          <li>Typing F1 anywhere in the GUI should bring up the
            appropriate section of the manual in the application
            configured for viewing HTML documents.</li>
          <li>The result list right click menu now has an entry to
            save the document to a file. This is only enabled for
            documents contained inside another file (ie, messages inside
            an mbox folder, or attachments), and is especially useful for
            extracting an attachment with no associated external
            editor.</li>
          <li>The preview window now has a right-click menu, with an
            entry to toggle between viewing the main text or all the
            metadata for the document. This is most useful in the case
            where the search match actually occurred in a field not
            visible in the main text (ie: author or HTML title).</li>
          <li>Words glued by an underscore character like
            <i>compound_word</i> are now split during indexing, and
            will be found when queried either as themselves or in a
            search for the components.</li>
          <li>There is now a size limit over which no attempt will be made to
            uncompress/identify/index compressed files. Not active by
            default, to be set in the <i>Indexing Configuration</i>.</li>
          <li>Added support for fetching field values from extended file
            attributes. This is not enabled by default, use 
            <i>configure&nbsp;--enable-xattr</i>. You'll also need to
            set up a map from the attributes names to the Recoll field
            names (see comment at the end of the <i>fields</i>
            configuration file.</li> 
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1.11.4">1.11.4</a></h2>
	<ul>

          <li>Bugs fixed:
            check the <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_11_1">list</a>.</li>  

          <li>The right-click menu "Copy" commands inside the result list
            now copy to the clipboard in addition to the main selection,
            enabling subsequent ^v commands.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1.11.0">1.11.0</a></h2>

	<p><i>Recoll release 1.11 has relatively extensive changes that have
            necessitated a modification of the index format. Hence installing this
            release implies a full re-indexing, which is enforced by the
            software.</i></p> 

	<ul>
          <li>Filtering on category (message/text/media etc.) as a function of
            the main window for quick access.</li>

          <li>Use html for preview when available (ex: html files or "colorized"
            python) instead of converting to text. This can be turned of in the
            preferences. </li>

          <li>New Python query and index interfaces. The Python query
            interface will be used for building a Xesam adapter for
            Recoll when the specification is stabilized, and could be
            useful for other things, such as indexing contents from an
            RDBMS (see 
            <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.PROGRAM.API">
              the manual</a> for details). Restructured and cleaned up
            internal Recoll interfaces.</li>

          <li>Improved filter framework. Can now process either html or text output
            from the filters, and more easily execute "raw" commands instead of
            Recoll scripts. Avoided wasteful repeated execution of filters for
            which the helper application is missing.</li>

          <li>Query language now closer to Xesam specification, (but
            still far from a 
            complete implementation). See the Recoll manual and
            <a href="http://www.xesam.org/main/XesamUserSearchLanguage">
              http://www.xesam.org/main/XesamUserSearchLanguage</a> </li>
          
          <li>Much improved configuration for fields. Fields like
            "author" can now be specified as storable (displayable in
            results) and/or indexed (searchable). Added alias facility
            for translating from user-level names to internal.</li>

          <li>Added "recipient" as an indexed/searchable field for emails.</li>

          <li>rcltext filter for processing text such as C code for which no specific
            processing is needed when indexing but a specific viewer is
            desired.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1.10.6">1.10.6</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li>Fix a simple and mildly nasty bug that would cause the
            indexer to stop 
            indexing an mbox on encountering a specific but not exceptional error
            condition (like a few dozen errors while indexing attachments for which
            no filter was installed).</li>
	</ul>


	<h2><a name="1.10.5">1.10.5</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li>Ensure that file names indexed as terms don't overflow the maximum term
            size.</li>

          <li> Handle non-standard date format in mbox separator lines sometimes
            generated by thunderbird.

          <li> Use attachment file names to help identify a better mime type for
            parts only described as application/octet-stream

          <li> For Phrase/Near searches, highlight all term groups in preview, not just
            the first

          <li> Added Open XML filters

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.10.2">1.10.2</a></h2>
	<ul>

          <li>Fixed openSuse 11 compile issues.

          <li>Fixed bug in interpreting email mime structure, which resulted in base-64
            decoding errors.

          <li>Fixed "Prev" button in preview window. Would actually go forward when
            walking the search terms.

          <li> Allow setting the highlight color for search terms in result list and
            preview (yes: feature change, should have waited for major release...)

          <li> Added svg filter

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.10.1">1.10.1</a></h2>
	<ul>

          <li> Ensure that in case the data of a file can't be indexed because of some
            error, at least the file name is indexed.

          <li> Improve query language to support OR queries of terms with field
            specifications (ie: title:someterm OR author:someauthor).

          <li> Fix filename search to split patterns on white space, so that 
            a "*.jpg *.jpeg" search does what's expected. Means you now need to use
            double-quotes if there is actual embedded white space.

          <li> Jump directly to the external editor choice dialog instead of opening
            preferences when an external viewer is not found.

          <li> Allow stopping indexing through menu action (only works with qt4 for now).

          <li> Create an "indexedmimetypes" configuration variable to allow explicitely
            restricting the file types which do get indexed.

	<h2><a name="1.10.0">1.10.0</a></h2>
	<ul>

          <li> Added a GUI dialog to configure the indexing parameters.

          <li> Added better support for indexing CJK text (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). 
            Please note that:
            - You will need a full reindex to take good advantage of this. (You
            *don't* need to reindex if you don't need to search CJK, even if there
            is some in your index).
            - When entering CJK search terms, words (single or multiple characters)
            should be separated with white space.
            - The specific CJK processing can be turned off by setting the nocjk
            variable to true in the configuration file (this may make sense if you
            have a mixed cjk/other document base and don't want to index the cjk
            part, as it will save some disk space and a minuscule amount of cpu).

          <li> Changed the way Recoll handles searches including composite words (like
            an email address). The new approach looks saner, but could have
            side-effects, please report any problems in this area.

          <li> The query language got a new "dir:" specifier to filter results on location.

          <li> New rclimg perl filter for better indexing of picture tags, thanks to
            Cedric Scott. This depends on Exiftool.
          <li> New rcltex filter.

          <li> Changed and improved how the preview window local search finds the
            query terms, this does not involve weird characters any more. The
            display is cleaner and cut and paste works better.

          <li> Fixed the fact that a newline-separated word list in simple search would
            wrongly trigger a phrase search.

          <li> Fixed the way we input text to the preview textedit (the old way would
            sometimes confuse the window into displaying tags instead of acting on
            them).

          <li> Fixed transcoding to utf-8 for text/plain email attachments

          <li> Improved mbox From_ line detection

          <li> Added indexedmimetypes variables to allow restricting the list of indexed
            mime types.

          <li> KDE kicker applet: start a recoll search from the panel and get a
            Recoll window. This is a clone from the find_applet, originally meant to
            start a Tracker search. Not so useful presently because it will start a
            new Recoll instance for every search. Not part of the main source (the
            configure script is a whopping 1MB...), linked from the download page.
          <li> Added recoll command line options to define a query and execute it
            immediately when the program starts. This is used in practice from the
            applet and could be used from other programs. There is a also a new
            option to not start the GUI and print the results to stdout.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.9.0">1.9.0</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Incompatible change: the icon image reference is now part of the result
            list paragraph format string:
            - If you had a standard config, you need do nothing.
            - If you had a custom format string, you need to add
            <img src="%I" align="left"> at its beginning to get the same result as
            before.
            - If you had unchecked the "show icons" option, you need to remove the
            above string from the paragraph format to make the icons go away.
            Changes to the format string are performed in the 
            "Preferences->Query Configuration->User Interface" dialog tab.

          <li> New filters: wordperfect, abiword and kword, rcljpeg, rclflac, rclogg
            (contributed filters). The jpeg and audio filters should be extended to
            make use of the new field indexing/search capability (hint :) )

          <li> When searching for an empty string inside the preview window, position
            the window to the next occurrence of a primary search term.

          <li> Added ext: and mime: selectors to the query language.

          <li> Added an adjustable flush threshold during indexing: should help control
            memory usage. See the idxflushmb configuration variable.

          <li> Added a check for file system free space. Indexing will stop if the
            threshold is reached. See the maxfsoccuppc configuration parameter.

          <li> Added 'followLinks' configuration option to have the indexer follow
            symbolic links while walking the tree (the default is false).

          <li> Allow symbolic links as 'topdirs' members. These are always followed.

          <li> Add preference option to remember sort tool state between program
            invocations (it is reset to inactive by default)

          <li> Added File menu entry to erase document history.

          <li> Bound the space and backspace keys to PgUp/PgDown in preview.

          <li> (Hopefully) Improved abstract (keyword in context) generation

          <li> Added support for arbitrary fields. Filters can now produce any number of
            fields which will be selectively searchable through the query
            language. This could be useful, for exemple, for the mp3 and jpeg filters
            (but it is not currently used).

          <li> Improved qt4 build: no more need for --enable-qt4. Note: the qt4 build
            still needs the qt3 support library.

          <li> Changed the icon to an ugly one. The previous one was nicer but looked
            too much like Xapian's.

          <li> Added some kind of support for a stopword list.

          <li> Have email attachments inherit date and author from their parent message
            (instead of mail folder).

          <li> Fix bus error on rclmon exit

          <li> Better handling of aspell errors inside rclmon

          <li> Fixed a number of qt4 glitches: selection and keyboard shortcuts.

          <li> New query configuration parameter to set the maximum text size beyond
            which text won't be hilighted before preview (takes too much time). This
            was a fixed value in 1.8.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.8.2">1.8.2 2007-05-19</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Fixed method name for compatibility with xapian 1.0.0
          <li> Add .beagle to default list of skipped names (avoids indexing beagle
            document cache...)
          <li> Fix configure.ac to use $libdir instead of /usr/lib
          <li> Fix recollinstall to properly copy translations and pictures for qt4

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.8.1">1.8.1 2007-02-20</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Add a small query language with some field-based searches (author, title,
            etc.)
          <li> Add wildcard handling everywhere. *, ?, [] can be used in any
            search. Warning: using a wild card at the left of a term can make
            for a very slow search.
          <li> Allow skipping specific paths during indexing (in addition to file name
            patterns)
          <li> Improved external index choice dialog, accessible from the top-level menu.
          <li> Many small bugs fixed: stemming language choice ignored in term explorer,
            qt4 preview window reentrancy crashes, issues with saving the default
            advanced search file, type filter, display more clearly missing helper
            errors, etc. 
          <li> Option to use the desktop defaults (with xdg-open) to choose the native
            viewer for files (instead of recoll's mimeview). 

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.7.6">1.7.6 2007-01-30</a></h2>

          <li> Fixes an issue with the openoffice filter on debian systems. 
          <li> Adds Scribus and Lyx filters.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.7.5">1.7.5 2007-01-15</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Fixes two email indexing bugs in 1.7.3, which would bail out from an
            mbox folder on the first attachment filtering error, and would decline
            to handle multipart/signed bodies. You may need to run a full indexing
            pass (recollindex -z), to force reindexing of old folders.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.7.3">1.7.3 2007-01-09</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Email attachments are now indexed.
          <li> Right-click menu option to access the parent document of an embedded
            result (ie from mail attachment to parent message), or the parent folder
            of a given file (which is opened with the application configured for
            directories) 
          <li> The sort tool has been improved: no need to restart the query after sort
            criteria change. 
          <li> Support for real-time indexing with inotify is now enabled by default
            when appropriate.
          <li> Recoll now warns when the configured native viewer can not be found and
            starts an interface for chosing another one.
          <li> Categories (text, presentation, spreadsheets, etc.) can be used instead
            of raw mime types when filtering on file types in advanced search.
          <li> The port to qt4 is functional and can be enabled with configure --enable-qt4
          <li> 'autophrase' option improved and may now actually be useful.
          <li> Improved highlighting (again...)
          <li> Display term frequencies in term explorer.
          <li> Recollindex -e to remove data from index for listed files.
          <li> Directory names now indexed. Directories can be 'edited' with the
            configured application (rox by default)

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.6.3">1.6.3</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Fixed problem with bad detection of mbox message boundaries.
            Upgrading can change the message numbering in some cases, and you should
            perform a full index update (recollindex -z) after installing
            the new version.
          <li> Fixed problem with execution of external viewer for files with
            single-quotes in the name.
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.6.2">1.6.2</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Minor solaris compilation glitches only.
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.6.1">1.6.1</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Term explorer: a multimode wildcard-regexp-spell/phonetic tool to search
            the index for terms. This uses aspell for the orthographic/phonetic part.
          <li> A more dynamic advanced search window. You now have a choice of the top
            level conjunction (OR/AND) and of any number of clauses, including NEAR
            and PHRASE clauses with an adjustable proximity parameter.
          <li> User-settable format for the result-list entries, which use an HTML
            string with %xx printf-like replacements (accessible from the user
            preferences).
          <li> Real time monitoring/indexing support. This is not configured by
            default, and must be specified at build time (configure --help).
          <li> Improved phrase/group highlighting in abstracts and preview
          <li> Better sample selection for synthetic abstracts.
          <li> Improved performance of the text splitter, good for indexing and previewing.
          <li> Shift+click link to open new preview window instead of tab in existing
            window.
          <li> The key sequence for term completion in the simple search entry was
            changed from CTRL+TAB to "Escape Space" to avoid interaction with window
            managers.
          <li> Improved recall for phrases with composite words like email addresses.


            Updating from 1.2 to 1.3 or 1.4 or 1.5: 
          <li>--------------------------------------
            From version 1.3 up, there is a new feature to search specifically for file
            names (with wildcard processing). If you want to take full advantage of
            this, you should perform a full reindex after installing the new version
            (ie: use recollindex -z, or delete ~/.recoll/xapiandb).
            Also, we now use the central copies of configuration files for default
            values, and the user ones only for overrides. Your old configuration files
            will still work, but, you may want to remove them if they are unmodified,
            or keep only the modified parameters.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.5.9 ">1.5.9 </a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Fix bad timezone conversion in email dates. Display timezone in result
            list dates.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.5.8">1.5.8</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Fix stored and displayed dates which used to come from the file's ctime,
            now use mtime (which was already used for deciding re-indexing).
          <li> Fix problem with some weird MIME messages (with null boundaries) which
            crashed the indexer.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.5.6">1.5.6</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Small fixes dealing with the build process or compiler issues. 
            1.5.6 has updated ukrainian and russian messages.
            Otherwise no functional changes, and no need to upgrade from 1.5.1

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.5.1">1.5.1</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Fix serious bug with non ascii strings in simple search history
          <li> Improve synthetic abstracts: remove size limitations, handle overlapping
            extracts, avoid printing several terms from the same position.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.5.0">1.5.0 2006-09-20</a></h2>
	<ul>

          <li> Added support for powerpoint and excel files, with the catdoc package.
          <li> Allow viewing consecutive documents from the result list inside a single
            preview window using the shift-arrow-up and shift-arrow-down keys.
          <li> Colorize search terms in abstracts in the result list.
          <li> A number of elements are now remembered between program invocations:
            sort criteria, list of ignored file types (always starts inactive), 
            subtree restriction, better handling of the recent searches listbox, the
            buildAbstract and replaceAbstract settings are not forgotten any more.
          <li> New option to automatically add a phrase to simple searches.
          <li> Possibility to adjust the length and context width for synthetic abstracts.
          <li> Handle weird html better.
          <li> When indexing mail messages, walk the full mime tree instead of staying
            at the top level, index all text parts and attachement file names.
          <li> Add -c <confdir> option to recoll and recollindex to specify the
              configuration directory on the command line
              <li> Better synchronization between the active preview and the highlighted
		paragraph inside the list
              <li> Improved recall for some special cases of stemming.
              <li> Much better handling of email dates, allowing better email sorting by
		date (previously the message date was quite often the date when the file
		was indexed).
              <li> Store the external database lists in the configuration directory, not the
		qt preferences.
              <li> Ensure dialogs are sized according to font size


	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.4.3">1.4.3 2006-05-07</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Multiple search databases. 
          <li> Optionally auto-search when a word is entered in the simple search
            field.
          <li> Show possible term completions in simple search by typing CTRL+TAB
          <li> Add 'more like this' option to result list right-click menu, to look for
            documents related to the current result.
          <li> Double-click in preview or result list adds the selected word to the
            simple search text field.
          <li> The simple search text entry field is now a combobox and remembers
            previous searches.
          <li> Additional OR field in complex search.
          <li> Improved indexing cancellability (interrupting recollindex or closing 
            recoll with an indexing thread active), and status reporting.
          <li> Fixed filters to handle file paths with embedded spaces.
          <li> Misc small bug and memory leaks fixes.
          <li> More compact result list.
          <li> Set mode 0700 on .recoll directory by default

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.3.3">1.3.3 2006-04-04</a></h2>
	<ul>
          <li> Implement specific search on file names with wildcard
            support. Indexing can optionally process all file names or only those
            with mime types supported for normal indexing. UPDATING: you need a
            full re-indexing to take advantage of this.
          <li> Use links and a right-click popup menu to replace confusing use of
            mouse clicks and double-clicks inside the result list.
          <li> The 'example' configuration files are now used as default, and are not
            copied any more to the user directory during installation. Overrides can
            be set in the personal files for any value that the user wishes to
            modify, with unchanged formats and file names (so that the files from
            previous versions remain valid, but you may wish to trim them of values
            that duplicate the central ones).
          <li> Use NLS information (LC_CTYPE, LANG) do determine default charset when
            possible.
          <li> Mp3 file indexing, either filenames only or also id3 tags if id3info is
            available. c/c++  ext edit. Use gnuclient instead of xemacs for text files.
          <li> Russian and Ukrainian translations and many improvement ideas thanks to
            Michael Shigorin.

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="1.2.3">1.2.3 2006-03-03</a></h2>

          <li> Improved preview loading: don't highlight very big documents (over 1Mb),
            allow cancellation while loading.
          <li> Abstracts generated in the result list by looking at search term
            contexts. This can slow down result list display for big documents, and
            can be turned off in the preferences menu.
          <li> Wrap query detail line displayed when clicking on result list header.
          <li> Text splitting cleanup with less spurious terms should result in
            slightly smaller databases.
          <li> Sligthly improved presentation in preview, esp. line breaks.
          <li> Color icons...
          <li> Let the user select the html browser used for help display.
          <li> autoconf/Makefile change: allow building UI from inside the qtgui
            directory. 
          <li> autoconf/Makefile: improved search and diagnostics for qt/qmake.
          <li> Internal code cleanup for maintainability: text splitting, user
            interface.
          <li> Added prototype kio_slave to show result inside Konqueror, doesn't seem
            particularly useful.</li>

          <li> Click on result list header will display the exact boolean search which
            was used.
          <li> recollindex can be used to create stem expansion databases independantly
            of a full indexing pass.
          <li> Misc user interface improvements, like an 'all terms' checkbox for
            simple search.
          <li> Fixed case-insensitivity issues. Probably needs more testing.
