      <h1><a href="http://www.recoll.org/">Recoll</a> is

      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> finds keywords
        inside documents as well as file names.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can search
          any <a href="features.html#doctypes">document format</a>.</li> 
        <li>It can reach any storage place: files, 
          archive members, email attachments, transparently
          handling decompression.</li>
        <li>One click will open the document inside a native editor or
          display an even quicker text preview.</li>
        <li>The software is free, open source,
	  and licensed under the GPL.</li>
        <li><a href="features.html">Detailed features</a>.
      </ul>
      <p>The current <span class="application">Recoll</span> version is
	<a href="download.html">1.17.3</a> 
	(<a href="release-1.17.html">Release notes</a>).</p>

      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> is based on the very
        strong <a href="http://www.xapian.org">Xapian</a> search
        engine library, for which it provides a powerful text
	extraction layer and a complete, yet easy to use, Qt graphical
	interface.</p>


      <p class="remark">Recoll will index an <b>MS-Word</b> document
      stored as an <b>attachment</b> to an <b>e-mail message</b> inside
	  a <b>Thunderbird folder</b> archived in a <b>Zip file</b>
	  (and more...). It will also help you search for it with a
	  friendly and powerful interface, and let you open a copy of
	  the file with a single mouse click. There is little that
	  will remain hidden on your disk.

      <h2>News</h2>
      <div class="news">
      <ul>
        <li>2012-06-01: an
          updated <a href="filters/filters.html">filter</a> for the 
          OpenDocument format will properly handle exported Google Docs
          files.</li> 

        <li>2012-05-25: a
          new <a href="filters/filters.html">filter</a> for indexing
          tar archives.</li>

        <li>2012-05-23: Release 1.17.3 mostly fixes an indexing crash that
          sometimes occurred  while processing email. See the 
          <a href="release-1.17.html">Release notes</a>. 
        </li>

        <li>2012-04-07: we now have a Chinese user manual: Recoll现在有中文手册咯：
        <a href="http://stupidbeauty.com/Blog/2012/03/recoll%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B6%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8A%E7%BF%BB%E8%AD%AF%EF%BC%8Crecoll-user-manual-2/">
          Recoll中文手册，HTML</a></li>

        <li>2012-03-27: Recoll gets a Ubuntu Unity Lens. If you are running
          an Ubuntu release where this makes sense, you can install
          the recoll-lens package from the 
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">
            Recoll PPA</a>. The Lens uses the Recoll GUI as a proxy to
          extract and display embedded documents, which native utilities
          can't reach directly. And of course you still need to run
          the GUI (or the command line recollindex) to get the indexing
          going !</li>

        <li>2012-03-24: Release 1.17 is out, see
          the <a href="release-1.17.html">Release notes</a>. </li>

        <li>2011-11-26: the result list glitch: ennoying and easily
          worked-around: it will sometimes happen (for a yet
          undetermined reason) that the result list paragraph format
          stored in the Qt preferences file will get garbled,
          causing result lists with no displayed paragraphs (the
          counts and pages are ok, the results can be seen in table
          mode, but not in list mode). The workaround is to go to
          <blockquote>
           Preferences->Query configuration->User interface
          </blockquote> and erase the result paragraph format string
          (^A DEL in the text area), this will reset the string to the
          default value.</li>

      <h2>Thanks</h2>
      <p>Recoll borrows a lot of code
	from other packages, and welcomes code and ideas from
	contributors, see some of the

      <h2>On the side</h2>

      <div class="news">
      <p>It doesn't appear likely that I'm going to become rich with
        Recoll any time soon (what with giving it away for free and
        all), so I've decided to use the home page to link to a few
        things that marginally kind of earn some money:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>We rent <a href="http://www.metairie-enbor.com/index.html.en">
	    a big country house</a> in the Aude area, in the south of
	  France (<a href="http://www.metairie-enbor.com/acces.html.en">see
	    map on the site</a>). If you are
	  looking for a wonderful country place with a pool to
	  spend holidays with a big bunch of family and/or
          friends in a nice historical but very quiet area, this may be it.</p>
        <p>And we also
          sell <a href="http://www.metairie-enbor.com/bois-de-chauffage.html">
            du <em>bois de chauffage</em></a> there too...</p>
