        <li>It can search

        <li>One click will open the document inside a native editor or

      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> is based on the very
        strong <a href="http://www.xapian.org">Xapian</a> search
        engine library, for which it provides a powerful text
	extraction layer and a complete, yet easy to use, Qt graphical
	interface.</p>

      <p class="remark">Recoll will index an <b>MS-Word</b> document
      stored as an <b>attachment</b> to an <b>e-mail message</b> inside
	  a <b>Thunderbird folder</b> archived in a <b>Zip file</b>
	  (and more...). It will also help you search for it with a
	  friendly and powerful interface, and let you open a copy of
	  the file with a single mouse click. There is little that
	  will remain hidden on your disk.

      <h2>News</h2>
      <div class="news">
      <ul>
        <li>2012-10-19: the source for <a href="recoll-1.18.001.tar.gz">
            recoll 1.18.001</a> is available, and this is a call to
            volunteers to test it. There are binary
            packages for Ubuntu and Mint Linux users, and I can build
            others. See this 
     <a href="http://www.freelists.org/post/recoll-user/recoll-1180-prerelease">
            message</a> for more information.</li>

        <li>2012-10-16: <a href="filters/filters.html">new filter for
            EPUB documents</a>.</li> 
        <li>2012-10-16: recoll 1.18 will soon be out. It will have

          optional character case and diacritics sensitivity, direct
          access to hit page when opening PDF files, complex search
          history, and a host of other smaller improvements. You can
          already see the <a href="release-1.18.html">release
          notes</a> and the snapshot currently on the 
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/experiments"> 
            "experimental" Ubuntu PPA</a> is actually a release
            candidate, so Ubuntu users can take an early plunge...</li>

        <li>2012-09-21: an
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/ElinksBeagle">easy
                 way</a> to extend the "Beagle queue"
         Recoll web history indexing mechanism to other browsers than
         Firefox (Elinks in this case).
         </li>

        <li>2012-09-13: the next Recoll version will maybe acquire switchable
          case and diacritics sensitivity. I am writing 
          a few pages about the
          issues involved, they are referenced from my  
          <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/113262930843833486941/posts">

        <li>2012-09-11: a new user-contributed script for those who use
          real-time indexing on laptops: stop or start indexing
          according to AC power status. See the details on
          the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/IndexOnAc.wiki">
            Wiki</a>. </li>

        <li>2012-06-19: update info. If you are not running Recoll 1.17.3,
          you probably should. 1.17.2 and older versions have a bug which
          can cause a crash of the indexing process while processing email,
          under relatively common conditions.<br>
          Also, if you are already running 1.17.3, you may want to install
          the updated open/libre-office filter described just below.</li>

        <li>2012-06-01: an
          updated <a href="filters/filters.html">filter</a> for the 
          OpenDocument format will properly handle exported Google Docs
          files.</li> 

        <li>2012-05-25: a
          new <a href="filters/filters.html">filter</a> for indexing
          tar archives.</li>

        <li>2012-05-23: Release 1.17.3 mostly fixes an indexing crash that
          sometimes occurred  while processing email. See the 
          <a href="release-1.17.html">Release notes</a>. 
        </li>

        <li>2012-04-07: we now have a Chinese user manual: Recoll现在有中文手册咯：
        <a href="http://stupidbeauty.com/Blog/2012/03/recoll%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B6%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8A%E7%BF%BB%E8%AD%AF%EF%BC%8Crecoll-user-manual-2/">
          Recoll中文手册，HTML</a></li>

        <li>2012-03-27: Recoll gets a Ubuntu Unity Lens. If you are running
          an Ubuntu release where this makes sense, you can install
          the recoll-lens package from the 
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">
            Recoll PPA</a>. The Lens uses the Recoll GUI as a proxy to
          extract and display embedded documents, which native utilities
          can't reach directly. And of course you still need to run
          the GUI (or the command line recollindex) to get the indexing
          going !</li>

        <li>2012-03-24: Release 1.17 is out, see
          the <a href="release-1.17.html">Release notes</a>. </li>

        <li>2011-11-26: the result list glitch: ennoying and easily
          worked-around: it will sometimes happen (for a yet
          undetermined reason) that the result list paragraph format
          stored in the Qt preferences file will get garbled,
          causing result lists with no displayed paragraphs (the
          counts and pages are ok, the results can be seen in table
          mode, but not in list mode). The workaround is to go to
          <blockquote>
           Preferences->Query configuration->User interface
          </blockquote> and erase the result paragraph format string
          (^A DEL in the text area), this will reset the string to the
          default value.</li>
