      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> finds keywords
        inside documents as well as file names.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can search
          most <a href="features.html#doctypes">document formats</a>.</li> 
        <li>It can reach any storage place: files, 
          archive members, email attachments, transparently
          handling decompression.</li>
        <li>One click will open the document inside a native editor or
          display an even quicker text preview.</li>

        <a href="BUGS.html">known bugs</a>).</p>

      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> is based on the very
        strong <a href="http://www.xapian.org">Xapian</a> search
        engine library, for which it provides a powerful text
	extraction layer and a complete, yet easy to use, Qt graphical
	interface.</p>

      <p class="remark">Recoll will index an <b>MS-Word</b> document
      stored as an <b>attachment</b> to an <b>e-mail message</b> inside
	  a <b>Thunderbird folder</b> archived in a <b>Zip file</b> (and
	  more...). It will also help you search for it with a friendly and
	  powerful interface, and let you open a copy of a PDF at the right
	  page with two clicks. There is little that will remain
	  hidden on your disk.

      <h2>News</h2>
      <div class="news">
      
      <dl>
        <dt>2014-04-03</dt> <dd>I have separated the code for the 
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/unity-scope-recoll">Recoll
            Unity Scope</a> from the main body of code, in hope that it may
          interest someone to work on it. It's Python and simple,
          mostly depending on the Unity API. The Ubuntu Unity API is
          apparently going to change *again* for the next version, and
          I think I've seen enough of it.</dd>

        <dt>2014-04-02</dt> <dd>1.19.12 is out. It's mostly identical
          to 1.19.11 apart from a new parameter to change the max size
          of stored attributes. No need to update in general.</dd>

        <dt>2014-02-27</dt> <dd>I hear from time to time about
          recollindex crashes. These appear to be quite rare, but they
          do happen, and I think that they are linked to a yet unfound
          bug in multithread indexing. If you experience such crashes or
          stalls, you can disable multithreading by adding the following
          to your recoll.conf:
          <pre><tt>thrQSizes = -1 -1 -1</tt></pre>
        </dd>

        <dt>2014-02-27</dt><dd>While working on a 
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/MuttAndRecoll">
            Recoll-Mutt interface</a> I discovered incidentally that
            the <a href="https://github.com/koniu/recoll-webui">Recoll
            Webui Web interface</a> works quite well with the 
          <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">links</a> web browser
          inside a terminal window. This appears to be an interesting
          solution for people looking for a search interface usable in
          a non-GUI environment.</dd>

        <dt>2013-11-19</dt> <dd>A <a href="filters/filters.html">new
            filter</a> for PowerPoint files. The previous one was
          based on the ancient <b>catppt</b> from the <b>catdoc</b>
          utilities and usually extracted nothing from more recent
          PowerPoint files (this is about .ppt: .pptx is handled by a native
          Recoll filter).</dd>

          <a href="http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/happysearch.html">
            just work</a>...</dd>

        <dt>2013-04-30</dt><dd>Thanks to some of its users, Recoll now
          has filters to 
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rcollnotesfiltr/">
            index and retrieve Lotus Notes messages</a> 
          (some 
          <a href="http://richardappleby.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/you-dont-have-to-know-the-answer-to-everything-just-how-to-find-it/">
            implementation notes from an early user</a>), and there is
            also now a 
            <a href="https://github.com/koniu/recoll-webui/">
              Web browser interface</a> for querying your Recoll
              indexes.</dd>  

        <dt>2012-10-25</dt> <dd>A problem with a simple workaround has caused
          several reported <span class="important">recollindex
          crashes</span> recently (for 1.17). If you store and index
          Mozilla/Thunderbird email out of the standard location
          (~/.thunderbird), you should add the following at the end of
          your configuration file (e.g.:
          ~/.recoll/recoll.conf): <pre><tt>
              [/path/to/my/mozilla/mail]
              mhmboxquirks = tbird
          </tt></pre> Adjust the path to your local value of course...
          Without this hint, recollindex has trouble finding the
          message delimiters inside the folder files, and will
          possibly use all the computer's memory and crash. Apart from
          crashes, which only occur for very big folders, this also
          causes incorrect mail indexing.
        </dd>

        <dt>2012-09-11</dt> <dd>A new user-contributed script for those who use
          real-time indexing on laptops: stop or start indexing
          according to AC power status. See the details on
          the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/IndexOnAc.wiki">
            Wiki</a>. </dd>

        <dt>2012-04-07</dt><dd>We now have a Chinese user manual:
