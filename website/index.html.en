      <h1><a href="http://www.recoll.org/">Recoll</a> is
	a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.</h1>

      <p>It is based on the very strong <a href=
	  "http://www.xapian.org">Xapian</a> search engine library, for
	  which it provides a powerful text extraction layer and a
	  complete, yet easy to use, Qt graphical interface.</p>

      <p><span class="application">Recoll</span> is free, open source,
	and licensed under the GPL. The current version is
	<a href="download.html">1.16.2</a> 
	(<a href="release-1.16.html">Release notes</a>).</p>

      <p class="remark">Recoll will index an <b>MS-Word</b> document stored as
	  an <b>attachment</b> to an <b>e-mail message</b> inside
	  a <b>Thunderbird folder</b> archived in a <b>Zip file</b>
	  (and more...). It will also help you search for it with a
	  friendly and powerful interface, and let you open a copy of the file
	  without much fuss. There is little that will remain hidden on 
	  your disk. 
        <a class="important" href="features.html">More details &hellip;</a></p>

      <p>If you have problems with
        Recoll, <a href="doc.html">documentation</a>
        and <a href="support.html">support</a> are available.</p> 

      <p><b><i>Recoll user ?</i></b> Maybe there are still a few useful
      	  search tricks that you don't know about. A quick look at
	the <a href="usermanual/rcl.search.tips.html">search
	tips</a> might prove useful ! Also the

      <h2>News: </h2>
      <div class="news">
      <ul>
        <li>2011-11-26: the result list glitch: ennoying and easily
          worked-around: it will sometimes happen (for a yet
          undetermined reason) that the result list paragraph format
          stored in the Qt preferences file will get garbled,
          causing result lists with no displayed paragraphs (the
          counts and pages are ok, the results can be seen in table
          mode, but not in list mode). The workaround is to go to
          <blockquote>
           Preferences->Query configuration->User interface
          </blockquote>
          and erase the result paragraph format string (^A DEL in the text area),
          this will reset the string to the default value.</li>

        <li>2011-11-07: release <a href="download.html#source">1.16.2</a>
          is out. It fixes a number of <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_16_1">
          bugs</a> in 1.16.1, ranging from small to ennoying depending on
          usage.</li>

        <li>2011-09-28: release <a href="download.html#source">1.16.1</a>
          is out. It fixes a GUI crash in 1.16.0 (see below) and a lyx filter
          issue.</li> 

        <li>
          <div class="important">
            <p>Notice for 1.16.0: the
              <tt>recoll</tt> GUI program sometimes crashes when running a query
              while the indexing thread is active. You should upgrade
              to 1.16.1</p> 
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>2011-09-03: release <a href="download.html#source">1.16.0</a>
          is out with many <a href="release-1.16.html">small improvements</a>
          over 1.15. </li>

        <li>2011-05-29: release 
          <a href="download.html#source">1.15.9</a> fixes a startup
          crash in 1.15.8. This occurs only on some architectures, and
          if you are not experiencing the problem (it happens every
          time if at all), you do not need to upgrade.
        </li>


        <li>2010-11-20 : wrote a small script so that recoll can be
          activated or hidden with a single keystroke on the gnome
          desktop. See the 
          <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/HotRecoll">
            installation recipee here</a>.</li>

        <li>2010-01-29 : the full Recoll source repository is now
          hosted on 
	  <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll">Bitbucket</a>,
          along with a Wiki
          (<a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/FaqsAndHowTos">
          Faqs and Howtos</a>) and an
          <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/issues">
	    issues tracking system</a>. Hopefully, this
          new channel for reporting bugs and make suggestions will
          increase the feedback rate...</li>
