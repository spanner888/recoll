      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.20.x</h1>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 </p>

      <p>Installing 1.20 over an 1.19 index is possible, but there
        have been small changes in the way compound words (e.g. email
        addresses) are indexed, so it will be best to reset the
        index. Still, in a pinch, 1.20 search can mostly use an 1.19
        index.</p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (you're not sure it's at least 1.18). The best method
        is to quit all Recoll programs and delete the index directory 
        (<span class="literal">
          rm -rf ~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then start <code>recoll</code>
        or <code>recollindex</code>. <br> 

        <span class="literal">recollindex -z</span> will do the same
        in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is off by default. It can be
        turned on <em>only</em> by editing
        recoll.conf (
        <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the
        index.</p> 


	  <h2><a name="minor_releases">Minor releases at a glance</a></h2>

	  <ul>
            <li>1.20.6 fixes some decompression issues with serious
              performance and system load consequences in some cases
              (depending on data): minimum checking that enough temp
              space is available before uncompressing, no need to
              uncompress tar.gz files. Also: rclscribus fixes, Danish
              translation and fix messages in two places which were
              not translated.<br/>
              Uncompressing big files to /tmp for nothing (and re-doing it on
              the next indexing pass...) was, I believe the main
              remaining reason why Recoll indexing could cause system
              performance issues.</li>
            <li>1.20.5 is 1.20.4 with a few Qt 5 compatibility
              tweaks. Builds and runs with Qt 5.3.2, fails with 5.2.</li>
	    <li>1.20.4 has a fix to skip compress file system images
	      like xxx.img.gz by default. This should have been in 1.20.3</li>
            <li>1.20.3 has a very minor change to copy the Query
              Fragments Window config file from the default if it does
              not exist in the user config dir.</li>
	    <li>1.20.2 fixes a bug which prevented the real time indexer
	      from indexing the web history queue (this was still processed
	      when starting up). It also adds systray capability to
	      the GUI.</li> 
	  </ul>


      <h2>Changes in Recoll 1.20.1</h2>

      <ul>
          
          <li>An <em>Open With</em> entry was added to the result list
            and result table popup menus. This lets you choose an
            alternative application to open a document. The list of
            applications is built from the information inside
            the <span class="filename">
              /usr/share/applications</span> desktop files.</li>

          <li>A new way for specifying multiple terms to be searched
            inside a given field: it used to be that an entry lacking
            whitespace but splittable, like [term1,term2] was
            transformed into a phrase search, which made sense in some
            cases, but no so many. The code was changed so that
            [term1,term2] now means [term1&nbsp;AND&nbsp;term2], and
            [term1/term2] means [term1&nbsp;OR&nbsp;term2]. This is
            useful for field searches where you would previously be
            forced to repeat the field name for every term.
            [somefield:term1&nbsp;somefield:term2] can now be expressed as
            [somefield:term1,term2].
          </li>

          <li>(1.20.1) The <b>Query Fragments</b> tool was added to
            the GUI. This is a window with customizable buttons to add
            arbitrary query language fragments to the current
            search. The buttons and fragments are defined in an xml
            file inside the recoll configuration
            directory <span class="filename">~/.recoll/fragbuts.xml</span>. This
            makes it easy to define "pre-cooked" filters for things
            that you need repeatedly.
            <a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.SEARCH.GUI.FRAGBUTS">
              See the manual</a> for more details.</li>

          <li>We changed the way terms are generated from a compound
            string (e.g. an email address). Previously, for an address
            like <em>jfd@recoll.org</em>, only the simple terms and
            the terms anchored at the start were generated
            (<em>jfd</em>, <em>recoll</em>, <em>org</em>, <em>jfd@recoll</em>, <em>jfd@recoll.org</em>). The
            new text splitter generates all the other possible terms
            (here, <em>recoll.org</em> only), so that it is now
            possible to search for left-truncated versions of the
            compound, e.g., all emails from a given domain.</li>

          <li>(1.20.1) New keyboard accelerators for the result table: Ctrl+r
            switches the focus from the search entry to the table,
            Ctrl+o opens the document for the current line, Ctrl+Shift+o
            opens document and closes recoll, Ctrl+d previews the
            document.</li> 

          <li>(1.20.1) A special term is now indexed for results from the web
            history: use "-rclbes:BGL" to exclude the web results,
            "rclbes:BGL" to restrict the results to the web ones. This
            is difficult to remember, but the Query Fragments feature
            means that you don't need to (this is in the sample Query
            Fragments file).</li>

          <li>Recoll now indexes <em>#hashtags</em> as such.</li>

          <li>It is now possible to configure the GUI in wide form
            factor by dragging the toolbars to one of the sides (their
            location is remembered between sessions), and moving the
            category filters to a menu (can be set in the 
            "Preferences->GUI configuration" panel).</li>
            
          <li>We added the <em>indexedmimetypes</em> and
            <em>excludedmimetypes</em> variables to the configuration
            GUI, which was also compacted a bit. A bunch of
            ininteresting variables were also removed.</li>
            
          <li>When indexing, we no longer add the top container
            file name as a term for the contained sub-documents (if
            any). This made no sense in most cases, as it meant that
            you would get hits on all the sections from a chm or epub
            when the top file name matched the search, when you
            probably wanted only the parent document in this case.<br>
            However, the container file name was sometimes useful for
            filtering results, and it is still accessible, in a
            different way: the top container file name is added as a
            term to all the sub-documents, <em>only for searching with
            a prefix</em>. The field name
            is <span class="literal">containerfilename</span>, and no
            match on the subdocuments will occur if the field is not
            specified (this is different from
            previous <span class="literal">filename</span> processing,
            which was indexed as a general
            term. <span class="literal">containerfilename</span> is
            also set on files without sub-documents (e.g. a pdf).</li>

          <li>A new attribute, <span class="literal">pfxonly</span>,
            was created to support the above change. This can be set
            on any metadata field inside
            the <span class="literal">[prefixes]</span> section of
            the <span class="filename">fields</span> file. The
            affected field terms will be indexed <em>only with a
            prefix</em>, so they will cause a hit only for a field
            search (the general behaviour is that field terms are
            indexed both prefixed and not, so they can also cause a
            hit when searched as general terms).</li>

          <li>A new <span class="literal">[queryaliases]</span>
            section was created in
            the <span class="filename">fields</span>, for definining
            field name aliases to be used only at query time (to avoid
            unwanted collection of data on random fields during
            indexing). The section is empty by default, but 2 obvious
            aliases are commented: <span class="literal">filename=fn</span>
            and <span class="literal">containerfilename=cfn</span>. Setting
            them in your personal file may save you some typing if you
            search on file names.</li> 

          <li>You can now use both <em>-e</em> and  <em>-i</em> for
            erasing then updating the index for the given file
            arguments with the same <em>recollindex</em> command.</li>

          <li>We now allow access to the Xapian docid for Recoll
            documents in <span class="command">recollq</span> and
            Python API search results. This allows writing scripts
            which combine Recoll and pure Xapian operations. A sample
            Python program to find document duplicates, using MD5
            terms was added. See 
            <span class="filename">src/python/samples/docdups.py</span></li>

          <li>The command used to identify the mime types of files
            when the internal method fails used to be hard-coded
            as <span class="literal">file -i</span>. It is now
            possible to customize this command by setting
            the <span class="literal">systemfilecommand</span> in the
            configuration. A suggested value would
            be <span class="filename">xdg-mime</span>, which sometimes
            works better than <span class="filename">file</span>.</li>

          <li>The result list has two new elements: %P substitution
            for printing the parent folder name, and an <tt>F</tt>
            link target which will open the parent folder in a
            file manager window. e.g. <tt>&lt;a&nbsp;href='F%N'&gt;Open parent directory&lt;/a&gt;</tt>
          </li>

          <li><span class="filename">/media</span> was added to the default
            skippedPaths list mostly as a reminder that blindly
            processing these with the general indexer is a bad idea
            (use separate indexes instead).</li>

          <li><span class="command">recollq</span>
            and <span class="command">recoll&nbsp;-t</span> get a new 
            option <span class="literal">-N</span>  to print field
            names between values when 
            <span class="literal">-F</span> is used. In addition, 
            <span class="literal">-F&nbsp;""</span> is taken as a
            directive to print all fields.</li>

          <li>Unicode <span class="literal">hyphen</span> (0x2010) is
            now translated to ASCII
            <span class="literal">minus</span>
            during indexing and searching. There is no good way to
            handle this character, given the varius misuses of minus
            and hyphen. This choice was deemed "less bad" than the
            previous one.</li>

<!--          <li>The purple filter (for pidgin and other messaging apps)
            has been updated for newer log formats.</li> -->
