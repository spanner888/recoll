      <h1>Updated filters for Recoll</h1>
      
      <p>The following describe new and updated filters, which will be
      part of the next release, but can be installed on the current
      release if you need them.</p>

      <p>For updated filters, you just need to copy the script to the
      filters directory which may be typically either <span
      class="filename">/usr/share/recoll/filters</span>, or <span
      class="filename">/usr/local/share/recoll/filters</span>. Please check
      that the script is executable after copying it, and make it so if
      needed (chmod a+x <i>scriptname</i>)</p>

      <p>For new filters, you'll need to copy the script file as
	above, possibly install the supporting application, and usually
	edit the 
	<span class="filename">mimemap</span>, 
	<span class="filename">mimeview</span> and
	<span class="filename">mimeconf</span> files, either in the
	shared directory
	(<span class="filename">
	  /usr[/local]/share/recoll/examples</span>), or 
	in your personal configuration directory 
	(<span class="filename">$HOME/.recoll</span> or 
	<span class="filename">$RECOLL_CONFDIR</span>).</p>
      
      <p>Alternatively, you can replace your system files with
	these updated and complete versions:
	<a href="mimemap">mimemap</a>
	<a href="mimeconf">mimeconf</a> 
	<a href="mimeview">mimeview</a> </p>

      <blockquote>
	<p>All filters are up to date in Recoll 1.16.2, except
	  rclchm, and the new ones for gnumeric and Okular annotations.</p>
        <p>Recoll 1.15 may benefit from some of the newer
          filters linked below.</p>
        <p>If you are running an older recoll version, you really
          should upgrade.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Okular annotations</h2>
      <p><a href="rclokulnote">rclokulnote</a>. Okular lets you create
        annotations for PDF documents and stores them in xml format
        somewhere under ~/.kde. This filter does not do a nice job to
        format the data, but will at least let you find it...</p>

      <h2>Gnumeric</h2>
      <p><a href="rclgnm">rclgnm</a>. Needs xsltproc and gunzip.</p>

      <h2>Rar archive support</h2>
      <p><a href="rclrar">rclrar</a>. This is up to date in Recoll
        1.16.2 but may be added to Recoll 1.15. It needs the Python
               rarfile module. </p> 

      <h2>Mimehtml support</h2>
      <p>This is based on the internal mail filter, you just need to
        download and install the configuration files (mimemap and
        mimeconf. Will only work with 1.15 and later.</p>

      <h2>Konqueror webarchive (.war) filter</h2>
      <p><a href="rclwar">rclwar</a></p>

      <h2>Updated zip archive filter</h2>
      <p>The filter is corrected to handle utf-8 paths in zip archives: 
        <a href="rclzip">rclzip</a>. Up to date in Recoll 1.16, but
        may be useful with Recoll 1.15</p>

      <h2>Updated audio tag filter</h2>
      <p>The mutagen-based rclaudio filter delivered with recoll 1.14.2
	used a very recent mutagen interface which will only work with
	mutagen versions after 1.17 (probably. at least works with 1.19,
	doesn't with 1.15).
	You can download the <a href="rclaudio">corrected script
	here. Not useful with Recoll 1.5 or 1.6</a>.
