      <h1>Known bugs in current and older versions</h1>

      <p><i>Bugs that are listed in an older version section are
          supposedly fixed in later versions. Bugs listed in the
          topmost section may also exist in older versions.</i></p>

      <h2><a name="b_latest">recoll 1.17.10</a></h2> 

      <ul>
        <li>The version string was not correctly updated for 1.17.1, the
        help dialog and recollindex -v will print 1.17.0.</li>

        <li>It will sometimes happen that the result list paragraph format
          stored in the Qt preferences file will get garbled,
          causing result lists with no displayed paragraphs (the
          counts and pages are ok, the results can be seen in table
          mode, but not in list mode). The workaround is to go to
          <blockquote>
           Preferences->Query configuration->User interface
          </blockquote> and erase the result paragraph format string
          (^A DEL in the text area), this will reset the string to the
          default value.</li>
        <li>Real time indexer: when running with gamin on FreeBSD, the
          indexer can deadlock in the gamin dialog in some
          cases.</li>
        <li>After an upgrade, the recoll GUI sometimes crashes on
          startup. This is fixed by removing (back it up just in case)
          ~/.config/Recoll.org/recoll.conf, the QSettings storage for
          recoll.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="b_1_17_0">recoll 1.17.0</a></h2> 
        <li>The chm filter handles badly some CHM files with encoded
          internal URLs (the whole file or some parts are not
          indexed). There is an updated filter on the filters section
          of the download page.</li>
        <li>The application style sheet is not reapplied when changed
          from the preferences menu, you have to restart the GUI.</li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_16_2">recoll 1.16.2</a></h2> 
        <li>Real time indexer: directory moves are not handled at
          all. Workaround: restart indexer from time to time.</li>
        <li>Real time indexer: file move events are not detected when
          running with inotify (at least for recent
          versions). Workaround: restart indexer from time to time.</li>
        <li>Cancelling a preview in the GUI will also cancel the indexing
          thread if it is running.</li>
        <li>Under Solaris, it is necessary to perform the initial
          indexing with the recollindex program. For some unknown reason,
          the recoll index thread does not work for creating the database.
          The only idea I have is a problem with exception handling (recoll
          catches an exception while trying the yet inexistant db).</li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_16_1">recoll 1.16.1</a></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>At least on OpenSUSE 12.1 / Qt 4.7.4 (and probably other
          environments), the links to Preview or Open inside the
          result list do not work. Also the GUI can crash if a
          temporary directory creation fails.</li>
        <li>The Python filters can crash under certain error
          conditions. This is a benign error, affecting just 
          the current document, but it causes system reports.</li>
        <li>The query is run 2 times, in most cases. This does not
          cause a too dramatic performance impact because of caching but
          still...</li>
        <li>The output from some filters (most typically text files
          out from the zip filters) is sometimes not transcoded
          correctly to UTF-8, causing myriads of error messages (and a
          possible application crash due to another bug in the unac
          code, described further).</li>
        <li>There is a compilation issue on Linux systems with a 3.x
          kernel.</li>
        <li>Queries without search terms (ie: all files of a given
          mime type) fail with an "empty query" diagnostic.</li>
        <li>The recollq command line query program sometimes does not
          clean up its temporary directory.</li>
        <li>Indexing can crash on files with weird names (inconsistent with the
          locale) for which the format of the "file -i" command is
          unexpected. This is probably dependant on the type of system
          and/or locale. Workaround: arrange for the offending file
          not to be indexed (move it away or configure it out), or
          apply <a href="files/patch-badfileoutput.diff">this patch</a>,
          which should work with all versions from 1.13 to 1.16.1</li>
        <li>Under certain conditions, the indexer can use all
          available memory and crash. This is caused by a memory leak
          in an error handling path inside unac, and can only be
          triggered in specific conditions (all cases seen were from
          files inside zip archives). Workaround: arrange for the
          offending file not to be indexed (move it away or configure
          it out), or apply <a href="files/patch-unac-icclose.diff">this
          patch</a>, which should work with all versions from 1.13 to
          1.16.1</li>
        <li>The lyx filter does not correctly detect the Lyx version,
          needed for correct indexing.</li>
        <li>A typo in a memory reallocation call inside the firefox
          web history indexing module may cause problems in a highly
          improbable case.</li>
        <li>Directory creations are not processed by the real time
          indexer (for indexing directory names).</li> 
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="b_1_16_0">recoll 1.16.0</a></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>The <tt>recoll</tt> GUI program sometimes crashes when
          running a query while the indexing thread is active.
          Possible workarounds:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Upgrade to 1.16.1</li>
            <li>Use the command
              line <tt>recollindex</tt> program to perform indexing
              (usually just type "recollindex" in a console, or see "man
              recollindex").</li>
            <li>Do not run queries in <tt>recoll</tt> while the indexing thread
              is running (as indicated in the bottom status line).</li>
          </ul>      
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="b_1_15_7">recoll 1.15.7</a></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>The default filter for files in Microsoft Word format
          (application/msword, .doc), antiword, has trouble with some
          relatively rare files with a very small text, resulting in the
          following error message:
          <blockquote>
            I'm afraid the text stream of this file is too small to
            handle.
          </blockquote> 

          Only small files produced by Microsoft Word on a Mac, or by
          OpenOffice will trigger this message.<br>

          <b>Workaround</b>: install wvWare and modify
          mimeconf to use the rcldoc filter (instead of directly
          executing antiword). Rcldoc will try antiword, then will use
          vwWare if it is available. This will result in slightly
          slower indexing for all normal .doc files. This fix was made the
          default in 1.16</li>

        <li>Compressed man pages could not be previewed.</li>
        <li>Sorting by document and file size in the result table does
          not work.</li>
        <li>idxflushmb was not handled while deleting documents in the
          index, leading to almost unbounded memory usage.</li>
        <li>Email messages for which there would be an error indexing
          an attachment would not be indexed at all.</li>

        <li>Performing a full index with release 1.11 or newer, over a
          version created with a much older recoll release may
          sometimes end with an error saying "backend doesn't
          implement metadata".  If this happens, you need to delete
          the index directory (typically <em>~/.recoll/xapiandb/</em>)
          and restart indexing. For big indexes, to avoid losing
          time, removing the directory preventively may be preferable .</li>

        <li>Text files bigger than 2 GB can not be indexed.</li>

        <li>Using the GUI preview while the indexing thread is running
          will sometimes crash the GUI or provoke other
          strangeness. This happens much more rarely than in 1.15.7,
          but still occurs. Workaround if this happens too frequently:
          use the standalone recollindex program instead of the GUI
          thread.</li>

        <li>Real time indexer: uncontrolled concurrent access to
          the global configuration can cause a startup crash (mostly of
          big file trees because of timing issues).</li>

        <li>Using the result preview while the indexing thread is
          running will sometimes crash the GUI or provoke other
          strangeness. This is apparently due to insufficient
          protection of resources shared by several threads. After
          recent cleanup, the problem occurs quite seldom but it is
          not completely gone. The current and unsatisfying
          workaround, is to avoid the situation, for example by using
          the standalone recollindex program instead of the GUI
          indexing thread.</li>

        <li>The GUI preview function sometimes fails with a
          non-sensical message about a non-related missing
          helper.</li>

        <li>Most operations on the parent document in the result table
          view are not connected and do nothing.</li>

        <li>The operations on the parent document in the result list
	  right click menu (Preview and Open), do not work, they
	  access the file's parent directory instead.</li>

        <li>The GUI option to remember sort state between invocations
          only works for sort by date.</li>

        <li>The rclzip filter can't handle utf-8 in path names for archive
          members. An <a href="http://www.recoll.org/filters/rclzip">
            updated filter</a> is available. </li>

        <li>The rclzip and rclchm filters can't handle archive members
          with a colon (':') in the file name or path. The files are normally
          indexed and can be searched for, but they can't be displayed
          (neither opened nor previewed). There is a 
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/changeset/3751ea8ea179">
            patch</a> which fixes the issue (then needs full reindex for these
          files).</li>

        <li>The ignored suffixes list (recoll_noindex) is itself
          ignored in some cases.</li> 

        
        <li>The man filter creates groff temporary png files in the
          home directory.</li>

        <li>Indexing can hang or crash after an error occurs on an
          archive member (which should have affected only the relevant
          document).</li>

        <li>The initial indexing pass in the real-time indexer does
          not monitor the X11 session which can create problems if the
          user ends the section at this point.</li>

        <li>Starting the indexing thread inside the GUI while another
          indexer (batch or real-time) is active will silently
          failed. It should show an error dialog.</li>

        <li>When an open error occurs on an external index while
          starting the GUI, the initial indexing dialog is started,
          which is incorrect because it cannot fix the problem.</li>

        <li>The result table row height is not adjusted according to
          default font size, and the vertical position of text in cells
          is often bad.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="b_1_15_5">recoll 1.15.5</a></h2> 
      <li>The Python and PHP modules in 1.15.5 have compile errors. This
        is solved by 
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/changeset/0b09b33cd06a">
          this simple change.</a></li>
      <li>The current stemming language is not indicated by menu
        checkboxes.</li> 

      <h2><a name="b_1_15_2">recoll 1.15.2</a></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>If a result table column is both added and moved in the same
          GUI instance, the list becomes garbled (or/and the GUI
          crashes). Workaround: remove the Qt GUI config
          (.config/Recoll.org/recoll.conf), and perform the operation in 2 GUI
          sessions: add column, exit recoll, restart, move column.</li>

        <li>Clicking one of the category filter checkboxes
          (one of the media/message/text/... things) with an empty result
          list crashes the GUI (just like this, yeah, I know, quality
          insurance etc.). Workaround: don't click these before running the
          first query.</li>

        <li>Changing the indexing configuration parameters from the GUI
          while the indexing thread (not an external recollindex command) is
        running will sometimes (quite often) crash the GUI.</li>

        <li>Script files (ie: .sh .pl) indexed as text do not respect
        the maximum text file limit (a problem with, ie, shar archives
        identified as application/x-shellscript).</li>

        <li>indexing script for xml formats (ie: svg) sometimes stall for
        30 S while xsltproc tries to access remote dtds.</li>

        <li>recollindex inapproprietely sets the nice value for its whole
        process group. In certain cases where the indexing monitor was
        launched at session start, this could set the whole session to low
        priority!</li>

      </ul>

      <h2><a name="b_1_14_4">recoll 1.14.4</a></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>rclmon.sh stop would not work.</li>
        <li>Some shell, awk, and perl scripts are not indexed. There is a
        simple <a
        href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/issue/39/some-shell-and-other-scripts-are-not">
       configuration tweak</a> workaround
        <li>The tree walk in indexing could loop on symbolic links.</li>
        <li> If the user-chosen result list entry format results in
          several paragraphs (in the qt textedit sense), right clicks
          will only work inside the first one for each entry.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="b_1_14_3">recoll 1.14.3</h2>
      <li>Email message preview is broken.</li>
      <li>The new mutagen-based audio tags filter (rclaudio) only
	  works with very recent mutagen
	  versions. See <a href="filters/filters.html">here</a> for a
	  corrected version.</li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_14_1">recoll 1.14.1</h2>
      <li>Compressed file view fix broke help viewer.</li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_14_0">recoll 1.14.0</h2>
	<li>Does not compile with Xapian
	  1.2. Apply <a href="files/xapian12.patch">patch</a>.</li> 
        <li> When a mime type has an external viewer defined, but the
          actual file is compressed (ie: xxx.txt.gz), recoll will try
          to start the external viewer on the compressed file, which
          will not work in most cases.</li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_13_04">recoll 1.13.04</h2>
        <p><b>Note:</b> some of the bugs listed here are not actually
        "fixed", mostly they were problems caused by old versions of
        external software (ie: kde, qt), and I stopped carrying them. Just
        don't use these versions, or live with the problem.</p>

        <li>In case a new style filter (persistent) crashed while indexing,
          it was not restarted, and all further files of the same mime type
          were not updated (ie: python zip crash on encrypted files).</li>

	<li>Mac OS X + Qt 4.6.1 : the index configuration dialog
	  crashes. Fixed with Qt 4.7.</li>

        <li>If you are seeing a delay of a few seconds before the
          result list displays for the first query of a recoll
          instance, try changing the result list font in the query
          preferences. This is not a recoll problem, I don't know the
          exact cause (I've seen it happen with "Sans Serif" and go
          away with Helvetica or Arial).</li>

        <li>It seems that the recoll program sometimes segfaults when
          exiting after the first execution ?</li>

        <li>When Recoll is built with qt 4.4.0, the icons in the
          result list are all displayed at the top of the page and
          garbled. This appears to be a qt bug, fixed in 4.4.1. Use
          either qt 4.3.x or 4.4.1 (stopped carrying this bug. Just don't use
          4.4.0)</li> 

        <li> Under some versions of KDE (ie: Fedora FC5 KDE
          3.5.4-0.5.fc5), there is a problem with the window stacking
          order. Opening the "browse" file selection dialog from the
          advanced search dialog will stack the latter under the main
          window, possibly making it invisible. This is quite probably
          a Kwin bug, possibly related to
          http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79183 or a correction
          thereof.</li>


      <h2><a name="b_1_13_02">recoll 1.13.02</h2>
        <li>Stemming does not work in the 1.13 series. The stemming
        database was not created at all. Things would sort of work as
        long as an older stemming database was around (which is why
        this was not discovered earlier.</li>
       <li>Fix the lyx filter to properly handle embedded white space in
        file paths.</li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_13_01">recoll 1.13.01 + xapian 1.0.16</a></h2> 
      <li>The GUI display is garbled under Qt 4.6.1 and newer. This is
      a Qt bug, and a workaround was put in place in Recoll 1.13.02
      for Qt 4.6.1. If you are using a newer version and the problem
      is still there, you can fix the
      4.6.1 fix to hopefully work with your Qt version: edit
      qtgui/rclmain_w.h, around line 37 (there is only one instance),
      change:
<pre>
  #if QT_VERSION == 0x040601
  to  
  #if QT_VERSION >= 0x040601
</pre>
      </li>

      <h2><a name="b_1_13_00">recoll 1.13.01 + xapian 1.0.16</a></h2> 

      <li>The field value was ignored in field searches for phrases or
	capitalized words (ie: author:John or title:"the title").</li>
      <li>The GUI would sometimes crash during the first execution,
	after the dialog about starting configuration.</li>
      <li>kio-recoll was not fully updated for 1.13 internals.</li>
      <li>Would not compile on Solaris 8.</li>



      <h2><a name="b_1_12_4">1.12.4</a></h2>
        <li>There are two bugs specific to 64 bits system, affecting
          HTML display inside the preview window (wrong character set
          used in some cases, and problems with keyword highlighting).
	</li>


      <h2><a name="b_1_12_3">1.12.3</a></h2>
      
        <li>Specific File Name searches and Query Language searches
          for a 'filename:' field sometimes give different results due
          to the way we handle wild card expansion.</li>

        <li>Killing recollindex sometimes left filter processes
          sleeping around.</li>

        <li>The last entry in a configuration file was ignored if it
          was not followed by a newline (either the file had no ending
          newline or the line ended with backslash followed by the last
          file line.</li>

       <li>Non-ascii characters in path names did not work well from
         the configuration GUI (editing the configuration files did
         work).</li> 

       <li>Accented characters in mail headers encoded according to a
         lax interpretation of rfc2047 were sometimes not decoded.</li>

       <li>Recoll dumps core when exiting if the configuration was not
	 found.</li>

       <li>The Qt4 version sometimes did not display the
         status bar in the main window.</li>

       <li>Message boundaries were not detected inside mbox format

      following problem was corrected by Xapian 1.0.11 or
      1.0.12, and I can see no reason to use older versions and/or the
      patches below. However, they're kept around in case someone
      needs them.<br> 
      NEAR expansion errors: recoll performs stemming expansion inside
      NEAR clauses (except if prevented by a capitalized
      entry). Because of a Xapian bug (up to 1.0.12 (or 11?)), NEAR
      does not support multiple OR subclauses. This manifests itself
      by a 'not implemented' Xapian exception or an explicit error
      message. Workarounds:
          <ul>
            <li>Prevent expansion of NEAR terms (possibly except one) by
              capitalizing them.

            <li>Or apply the following patch to xapian, inside the

        <li>Unicode space characters like 
          <em>0x3000,&nbsp;Ideographic&nbsp;space</em>
          where not detected inside user entries like the main
          interface search entry. Badly parsed searches would retrieve no

              "champagne AND (ext:odt OR ext:sxw OR ext:lyx)"
          Workaround until the fix is issued: add non-existing terms

          entry or Ctrl+V in the target).</li>

        <li>Possibly harmful bug in strerror_r usage (GNU case).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1.10.6</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> If the locale is not utf-8, non-ascii command line
          arguments to recoll and recollq are not converted to utf-8,
          which may prevent, for example, the kde applet from
          working. The workaround is to apply the following one-line
          fix to qtgui/main.cpp, recompile and install recoll:
          <pre>
            386c386
            &lt;        sSearch->setSearchString(QString::fromUtf8(qstring.c_str()));
            ---
            &gt;        sSearch->setSearchString(QString::fromLocal8Bit(qstring.c_str()));
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1.10.1</h2>

      <ul>
        <li> A relatively simple error case can cause the indexer to
          stop processing an mbox file (forgetting all subsequent
          messages). More specifically, this happens when encountering
          more than than a few dozen errors while handling
          attachments. This is relatively common: for exemple if an
          external helper application is missing and multiple
          attachments of the affected type are found (ie: multiple
          images and no exiftool). Workaround: install the helper
          application.
        <li> The decoding of base-64 data in emails fails in a relatively uncommon 
          but sometimes encountered case.
        <li> In a preview window, when walking the search term hits with the
          Previous/Next buttons, 'Previous' actually acts as 'Next' (it does work
          normally for the local search).
        <li> Problems in detecting message separators inside Thunderbird mailboxes
          (quite probably mainly for messages imported from outlook?). Can lead to
          unindexed messages, and even apparently indexer crashes in some cases.
        <li> File names indexed as terms can sometimes overflow the maximum term
          size, halting the indexing.
        <li> For Phrase/Near searches, only the first term group is highlighted in
          preview. 
      </ul>

      <h2>1.10.0</h2>
      <ul>

        <li> If a filter fails while trying to extract the data from a file, the file
          will not be indexed at all (not even the file name). The file
          name should be indexed in this case. This happens in particular in the
          very common case where the helper application is not installed (ie:
          missing Exiftool -> no *.jpg names in the index).

        <li> If several query language "ext:" qualifiers are specified, they will be
          joined by an AND instead of OR, resulting in no results. Using an
          explicit OR doesn't work (actually OR + field names is generally
          broken). In some cases, you can use a "type:" qualifier as a workaround.


      </ul>
      <h2>1.9.x</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Problems have been reported indexing big mailstores (several hundreds of
          thousands of messages): resulting in a very big database and even
          crashes.

      </ul>
      <h2>1.8.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Under ubuntu (at least, maybe debian too), the default awk interpreter
          (mawk) is ancient, and the recoll pdf input filter does not
          work (removes all space characters). This can be solved by installing the
          gawk package. 
          $ apt-get install gawk
          $ update-alternatives --set awk /usr/bin/gawk

        <li> There are sometimes problems with document deletions: the index can
          get in a state where deleted or moved documents are not purged from the
          index (the log file says that the doc are deleted, but they aren't
          actually). When this happens, the only solution currently is to reindex
          from scratch (recollindex -z). This is due to a xapian bug, which is
          fixed in xapian 1.0.2, or you can apply the following patch to xapian
          1.0.1 to fix it:
          http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/xapian/xapian-delete-document.patch 

        <li> The dates shown for email attachments in a result list are the email
          folder modification date. This should be inherited from the parent
          message instead.

        <li> There are a few problems in the qt4 version of recoll: 
        <li> Some accelerators (esc-spc, ctl-arrow) do not work, neither do
          copy/paste between the result list and preview windows and x11
          applications. 
        <li> The qt4 q3textedit::find() method is extremely slow, so that
          positionning to first search term in Recoll preview has been disabled,
          and the application will sometimes appear to be looping when using the
          find feature in the preview window (it's not looping, it's searching...)

      </ul>
      <h2>1.8.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> This is not really a bug but .beagle really should be included in
          "skippedNames", or you end up indexing the beagle text cache, which is
          not really desirable.
        <li> Doc bug: the manual states that the query language supports a "mime:"
          switch to filter mime types. There is currently no such thing.


      </ul>
      <h2>1.7.5</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Debian and Ubuntu: the rclsoff Openoffice filter doesn't work,
          because of an incorrect shell syntax (understood by bash but not sh). To
          fix, you edit /usr[/local]/share/recoll/filters/rclsoff and can change
          the line:
          trap cleanup EXIT SIGHUP SIGQUIT SIGINT SIGTERM
          into:
          trap cleanup EXIT HUP QUIT INT TERM
          or download the updated filter from the filters page: 
          http://www.recoll.org/filters/filters.html

      </ul>
      <h2>1.7.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Processing will stop on first error while indexing an mbox file. This
          could happen just because an attachment could not be decoded, and can
          cause non-indexing of many messages. The most probable cause of error is
          a missing filter (ie for ms-word files), so the temporary workaround
          would be to install the missing filters. This bug is specific to 1.7 and
          1.6 users need not worry. A correction will be issued very soon.
        <li> Messages of type multipart/signed are not indexed. 

      </ul>
      <h2>1.6.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Relatively unfrequent issue with message boundary detection in mbox
          files, could cause miscellaneous problems.
        <li> Executing an external viewer for a file with single-quotes in the name
          would not work.

      </ul>
      <h2>1.5.10</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> If a defaultcharset was set in the configuration file for a subdirectory,
          it would stay in effect for all subsequent files/directories (except if
          explicitely overridden), potentially causing many transcoding errors.

      </ul>
      <h2>1.5.[1-7]</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Dates in result list come from the file's ctimes, which may be confusing
        <li> Some rare MIME messages with null boundaries can crash the indexer.

      </ul>
      <h2>1.5.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Under some conditions, recoll startup and exit could be very slow: the
          simple search history list had serious problems with non-ascii strings,
          whose size sometimes doubled at each program startup/stop.

      </ul>
      <h2>1.3.3</h2>
      <ul>

        <li> Several of the external filters did not handle path names with embedded
          spaces (rcluncomp rclsoff rclps rclmedia rcldjvu). This is fixed in 1.4.

        <li> If your QT installation is built with the QT_NO_STL flag, Recoll will not
          compile. I have a patch for this (will be fixed in the next release),
          contact me if you get the problem. Typical error message:
          main.cpp:160: error: no match for 'operator+=' in 'msg += reason'

        <li> The 'None of these words' field in the complex search does not work if
          there are no other filled fields (it transforms into an ordinary
          search). Workaround: enter very common term(s) in the 'any of these
          words' field.

        <li> Indexing cannot currently be conveniently and cleanly
          stopped when it's started. You can kill the process, and
          keyboard interrupt might work, but this may leave the
          database in a bad state. This is fixed in the upcoming
          release, there is no current workaround.
      </ul>

      <h2>1.2.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> The preview window is supposed to scroll after loading the document so
          that the first search term is visible. This does not work in many cases.
        <li> The result list title is not shown for sorted lists

          Notes on older versions:
        <li> Trouble compiling on some linux systems (Gentoo and Slackware?). There
          existed a quite common issue where the Recoll link will fail trying to
          use a libstdc++.la file. This was due to a problem with the xapian-config
          program. A workaround has been included in the configure script for
          recoll 1.2.2, and the problem should not occur any more.

        <li> Case-insensitive search should now work in most cases
        (used to not work except for accented ascii).

        <li> All directories and files with names beginning with a dot were ignored
          by the skippedNames directive in the default recoll.conf file from
          older versions (no indexing of mozilla or thunderbird email !). An
          upgrade will not fix this (it will not modify an existing
          configuration). You need to edit recoll.conf by hand and remove the .*
          from skippedNames.</li>
