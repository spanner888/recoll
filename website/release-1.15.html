      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.15.0/1.15.9</h1>

      <p><em>Notes:</em>

        <ul>
          <li>1.15.9 fixes a startup crash in 1.15.8. This occurs only on
            some architectures, and if you are not experiencing the problem
            (it happens every time if at all), you do not need to
            upgrade.</li>

          <li>1.15.8 fixes quite a few bugs (see
            the <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_15_7">BUGS</a> file) and also
            breaks my promise to only fix bugs in minor releases because
            it also has a few small functional improvements (which
            actually border on the bug fix category):
            <ul>
              <li>Searches now allow negative directory filtering (all
                results except from the specified directory). Other
                attempts at still impossible negative searches (ie: <span
                class="literal">-mime:</span>) now cause explicit errors
                messages instead of lame results. The inverted directory
                filtering is accessible from the query language and by
                checking a checkbox in the advanced search panel.</li>

              <li>The GUI advanced search panel now allows specifying a
                field for each entry (ie: author/recipient, etc).</li>

              <li>Added filters for .war (Konqueror web archive) and
                .mhtm (other web archive format).</li>

              <li>Result table:
                <ul>
                  <li>The detail area now has a popup menu similar
                    to the one in the result list (open parent, save to
                    disk etc.).</li>
                  <li>Estimated result counts are displayed in the
                    status line.</li> 
                </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
        <li>1.15.6 and 1.15.7 almost exclusively fix build issues (except
          for the indication of the stemming language in the menu, fixed in
          1.15.7). If you are running 1.15.5, you probably don't need to
          upgrade.</li>
        <li>1.15.5 fixes more crashes still in 1.15.2. See the 
        <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_15_2">BUGS</a> file</li>
        <li>1.15.2 fixes the GUI startup crash described below, and an
          issue with very long path elements, which manifested itself mainly
          while indexing the Beagle queue.</li>
        <li>1.15.1 is identical to 1.15.0 except for a very
          small modification to allow building with qt 4.4.</li>
       </ul>
     </p>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p>There have been reports of the recoll 1.15 GUI crashing when
        starting up after an upgrade. This was fixed by making a
        backup of ~/.config/Recoll.org/recoll.conf and deleting it (Qt
        stores the QSettings for the recoll GUI in this file, things
        like the search history and mix GUI options).</p>

      <p>If the result list is displayed with strange indentations, try
      to completely clear the result list paragraph format (in query
      preferences) to reset it to the default. Next time you open query
      preferences, the new default format will be up, and you can make
      any desired changes.</p>
      <p>The support for Qt 3 has been removed in this version which
        uses only native Qt 4 interfaces. If your system has no
        support for Qt 4.4 or newer, you need to stick
        with <a href="download-1.14.html">Recoll 1.14</a>, which is
        still supported.</p>

      <p>The defaults for file name searches with multiple fragments
        changed from OR to AND: see the changes list below for more
        detail.</p> 

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: version 1.15/14/13
        indexes are mostly compatible with 1.11 indexes, but some features
        depend on a full index rebuild. These are:

        <ul>
          <li>Filtering results from a given directory subtree.</li>
          <li>Displaying simple filenames in the new result table.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

	<p>If installing over 1.10 or older, you need a full
	rebuild. The best way to do this is to just delete the old
	<span class="filename">.recoll/xapiandb</span> directory,
	especially if the index was created by an older version.
	(ie: <tt>rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb/</tt>).  On very
	old indexes, <tt>recollindex&nbsp;-z</tt> may sometimes end
	with a <em>backend doesn't implement metadata</em> error,
	which is wasteful because you then need to delete xapiandb and
	run the indexing again.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.15.0 has major new GUI features and fixes a number
      of small bugs</p> 

      <ul>

      <li>The GUI has a new display for the result list inside a
        spreadsheet-like table, with configurable columns and sort by
        any column. The table header right-click menu has the <i>reset
        sort</i> function and column adding/removing.The "classical" look
        is still there, you can dynamically switch between list and
        table by clicking the table-like icon in the toolbar. </li>

      <li>The old sort tool is gone. There are now vertical arrows in
        the tool bar to directly sort by date ascending or descending,
        which was its only significant use.</li>

      <li>We added duplication indicators to the result list when results
        are collapsed because they have bit-for-bit identical
        contents. The indicater is the collapse count in parentheses,
        displayed just after the relevancy percentage.</li>

      <li>There is now a menu entry to clear search history.</li>

      <li>File name search: it used to be that multiple fragments
        where OR'ed together to perform the search. They are now AND'ed,
        which makes more sense in many cases (remembering several
        fragments of the file name but not the order), but means that a
        search for <tt>*.doc&nbsp;*.odt</tt> will always
        fail. Use <tt>ext:doc&nbsp;OR&nbsp; ext:odt</tt> instead.</li>

      <li>Autophrase now works with the query language where it makes
        sense.</li> 

      <li>Support for lyrics in midi karaoke files. Works
        better with the
        Python <a href="http://chardet.feedparser.org/">chardet</a>
        character encoding identification module.</li>
        
      <li>Support newer Purple/Pidgin logs using an html format.</li>

      <li>Support thunderbird extreme brokiness in handling the mbox
        format: naked "^From $" separators are now accepted
        with <tt>mhmboxquirks&nbsp;=&nbsp;tbird</tt>.</li>

      <li>A change of method for filtering on directory location makes
        it much more efficient and faster.</li>

      <li>The utf-8 file name is now a stored field by default.</li>
      
      <li>We now catch all exceptions in Python filters to avoid
        crash reports from the system on benign filter failures.</li>

      <li>Indexing now creates a lock/pid file inside the
        configuration directory.</li>

      <li>Fixed parallel build issue on FreeBSD.</li>


      </ul>
