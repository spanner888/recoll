      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.16.x</h1>

      <p><em>Note:</em> No release has been made yet in this
      series. This document documents the progress of development, and
      the state of snapshots sometimes found on the download page, in
      a form which will hopefuly be found easier to read than the
      Mercurial changelog on BitBucket.</p>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>


      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.16 snapshots are
      fully compatible with 1.15 indexes for now. Perform a full index
      pass if installing over an older version. The simplest way to do
      this is to quit all recoll programs and just delete the index
      directory
      (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>). 
      <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span>
      will do the same in most cases.</p> 


      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.16 current change list:</p> 

      <ul>

        <li>Searches now allow negative directory filtering (all
          results except from the specified directory). Other attempts
          at still impossible negative searches
          (ie: <span class="literal">-mime:</span> now cause
          explicit errors messages instead of lame results. The
          inverted directory filtering is accessible from the query
          language and by checking a checkbox in the advanced search panel.</li>

        <li>The GUI advanced search panel now allows specifying a
          field for each entry (ie: author/recipient, etc).</li>

        <li>Added filters for .war (Konqueror web archive) and .mhtm (other web
          archive format).</li>

        <li>Result table:
          <ul>
            <li>The detail area now has a popup menu similar
              to the one in the result list (open parent, save to disk
              etc.).</li>
            <li>Estimated result counts are displayed in the status line.</li>
            <li>Set row height according to default font size, and better 
              adjust row height and vertical text position in
              cells.</li>
          </ul>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>UTF-8 paths inside ZIP archives were mishandled. Also
              fixes problem with colons inside archive member
              paths.</li>
            <li>Fixed GUI result list doc parent operations (open/preview)
              which were broken in 1.15.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
