      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.16.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.16 is
        mostly compatible with 1.15 indexes, except for a few differences
        for weird terms containing punctuation signs. Perform a full index
        pass if installing over an older version. The simplest way to do
        this is to quit all recoll programs and just delete the index
        directory (<span
        class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>), then
        start recoll or recollindex.  <span
        class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span> will do the same in most
        cases.</p>

       <p>Also, using the anchored search feature requires a full reindex.</p>

       <p>1.16.2: this is a bug fix release, (see the 
         <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_16_1">fixed bugs document</a>), with a few
         limited changes:
         <ul>
           <li>The indexer now puts itself in the ionice "idle" class by
             default (can be changed in the config).</li>

           <li>The verbosity level of some messages were adjusted so that a
             simple sequence of indexed files can now be seen while indexing
             with the verbosity at level 3 (info).</li>

           <li>New command line options for the recollq program add a fully
             parseable base64-encoded output mode, with full control on the
             list of fields printed for each result, for use by external
             programs.</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>The 1.16.0 GUI can be crashed quite easily, please
         just upgrade to 1.16.1 or later.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.16 is an incremental improvements release over 1.15, no
        major function was introduced or modified.</p> 

      <ul>

        <li>Images are displayed in preview. You can get at the fields
          and complete extracted text using the popup menu.</li>

        <li>The preview window popup menu has a "save to file" entry
          to write a subdocument (ie: mail attachement) to a file.</li>

        <li>The GUI advanced search panel allows specifying a
          field for each entry (ie: author/recipient, etc).</li>

        <li>It is now possible to anchor searches to the beginning or
          end of the text or field, by using <tt>^</tt> and <tt>$</tt>
          characters at the beginning or the end of a term or
          phrase. A maximum distance can be specified as a phrase
          slack either in the advanced search panel, or as a query
          language modifier, ie: <tt>"^beginterm"o10</tt> would search
          for <tt>beginterm</tt> within 10 terms of the beginning of
          the text. This feature was suggested to me (thanks Gökhan),
          for searching for a name at the beginning of a text
          (in the author list, as opposed to anywhere in 
          the text). This is useful for example in the very common
          case where the metadata for the author list was not
          created. More details about this feature are to be found in
          the <a href="http://www.recoll.org/doc.html">user
          manual</a>.</li> 

        <li>It is possible to configure the result list snippet
           separator, given as an html fragment. This is an ellipsis by
          default (&amp;hellip;). </li>

        <li>We can now perform negative directory filtering (-dir:/some/dir),
          to return all results except those from the
          specified directory (recursive). Other attempts at still
          impossible negative searches
          (ie: <span class="literal">-mime:</span>) now cause explicit
          errors messages instead of lame results. The inverted
          directory filtering is accessible from the query language
          and by checking a checkbox in the advanced search
          panel.</li>

        <li>Result table:
          <ul>
            <li>The detail area now has a popup menu similar
              to the one in the result list (open parent, save to disk
              etc.).</li>
            <li>The result table header popup menu has an entry to save the
              table as a CSV file.</li>
            <li>Estimated result counts are displayed in the status line.</li>
            <li>Set row height according to default font size, and better 
              adjust row height and vertical text position in
              cells.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>It is now possible to set an increased weight for indexing
          some fields. The title fields gets a boost by default. See
          the <tt>fields</tt> default file for details.</li>

        <li>The query language allows setting weights on terms, ie,
          as in: <tt>"important"2.5</tt> .</li>

        <li>Improved preservation of indentation for text files
          displayed in the preview window.</li>

        <li>Show hidden (dot) files in the indexing configuration
          GUI dialogs.</li>

        <li>Added filters for <tt>.war</tt> (Konqueror web
          archive), <tt>.mhtm</tt> (other web archive format)
          and <tt>rar</tt> archives.</li>

        <li>Improved handling for native cjk punctuation signs.</li>

        <li>Updated the list of native apps in the
          default <tt>mimeview</tt> (ie: xv->gwenview, rox->dolphin,
          etc.)</li>

        <li>Added -f option to recollindex to ignore
          skippedPaths/Names when used with -i. Allows the use of a
          purely external file selection mechanism.</li>

        <li>The performance of email indexing has been slightly
          improved (less CPU usage).</li>

        <li>Real time indexer: several configuration
          parameters allow adjusting the timing of indexing actions:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>monauxinterval</tt>: the interval between auxiliary
              databases rebuilds (stemdb, aspell).</li>
            <li><tt>monixinterval</tt>: The waiting period
              during which indexing events are accumulated prior to actual
              indexing (saves work on duplicate events).</li>
            <li><tt>mondelaypatterns</tt>: a list of file patterns for
              which indexing should be delayed longer (quick changing
              files like logs that should be reindexed much slower than
              they change).</li>
          </ul>
          See the default configuration file for more detail.
        </li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>UTF-8 paths inside ZIP archives were mishandled. Also
              fixes problem with colons inside archive member
              paths.</li>
            <li>Fixed GUI result list doc parent operations (open/preview)
              which were broken in 1.15.</li>
            <li>Fixed case where indexing could hang or crash after an
              error occured while indexing an archive member (which
              should have affected only the relevant document).</li>
            <li>Real time indexer: uncontrolled concurrent access to
              the global configuration could cause a startup crash (mostly of
              big file trees because of timing issues).</li>
            <li>Fixed sorting by document and file size in the result
              table.</li> 
            <li>Email messages for which there would be an error indexing
              an attachment would not be indexed at all.</li>
            <li>Text files bigger than 2 GB could not be indexed.</li>
            <li>Fixed the handling of compressed man pages.</li>
            <li>Memory usage could grow almost unbounded while deleting
              documents, because idxflushmb was not used for document
              deletions.</li> 
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
