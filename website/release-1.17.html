      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.17.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.17 is mostly
        compatible with 1.16 and 1.15 indexes, except for a few
        differences for weird terms containing punctuation
        signs. Also, file/document size computations have been
        improved in 1.17 and you'll need an index reset if you want to
        enjoy the new goodness. Always reset the index if installing
        over an older version (1.14 and older). The simplest way to do
        this is to quit all recoll programs and just delete the index
        directory
        (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>),
        then start recoll or
        recollindex.  <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span> 
        will do the same in most cases.</p>

      <p>Some new, auxiliary, features do require a full reindex to work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The file size filtering functions.</li>
        <li>The anchored search feature if the index was created by
          release 1.15 or older.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Notes to the kind packagers:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>you need to either depend on libqt4-webkit or run
          configure --disable-webkit (1st option preferred if possible
          of course).</li> 
        <li>The default build now installs the Python extension module.
          This means that it needs the Python development
          package. You can revert to the old behaviour by using  
          configure --disable-python-module.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.17 is an incremental improvements release over 1.16, 
        with quite a few changes under the hood (like the introduction
        of a webkit-based result list), but relatively few obvious
        changes for the casual user.</p> 

      <p>1.17.1 was released only for a small function needed for
        supporting the Unity Lens. If you don't need it, you can stay
        with 1.17.0.</p>
      
      <p>1.17.2 fixes a few <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_17_1">bugs</a> and
        adds a small feature for handling characters that should not
        be accented in your language (ie: Ã¥ in swedish). See
        <tt>unac_except_trans</tt>x in the manual configuration
        section. Also a new <tt>rcldia</tt> filter for Dia files.</p>

      <p>Recoll 1.17.0 changes:</p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>GUI/config: new set of dialogs to set up the indexing
          schedule, either as automatic real time indexing started
          with the user session or as discrete cron entries. This
          will take care of the details of autostart files or crontab
          editing.</li> 

        <li>Search: Recoll now supports filtering on file sizes. This
          is accessible from the advanced search panel, or from the
          query langage (ie: "size&gt;10k&nbsp;size&lt;1m"). For
          documents stored inside archives, the file size stored in
          the index is now the actual one, not the archive's as was
          previously the case. Because of this, you will need a full
          reindex to completely enable this feature.</li>
	
        <li>Query language: the "dir:" directive now accepts
          non-absolute paths. For example dir:dir1/dir2 will select
          any file the path of which includes "dir1/dir2".</li>

        <li>Query language: tilde is now expanded inside a "dir:"
          clause.</li>

        <li>General: the Python extension module is now installed by
          default. This will make it much easier to use small recoll
          integration and extension hacks like the Unity Lens.</li>

        <li>Desktop: there is a new Ubuntu Unity Recoll Lens, it is not
          installed by default, but quite easy to install, see
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/wiki/UnityLens">the
            Wiki page</a>.</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to cancel a query that takes too
          long. Because of limitations in Xapian, this forces a program
          exit, but it's probably better than staring at a hung
          Recoll.</li>

	<li>GUI/advanced search: the dialog gets new sections for
	  filtering on file dates and sizes, and has been split into two
	  tabs: for search terms, and for filtering.</li>

        <li>GUI: use Shift+PageUp instead of Shift+Home to rewind the
          result list to the first page. Shift+Home is useful in the
          search entry.</li>

        <li>GUI: the preview function will now check that the index is
          up to date before fetching the preview data, and propose to
          update the index if necessary. This is especially important
          for mail folders. It was previously possible that the
          preview would display a message unrelated to the current
          result.</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to control the date format 
          displayed by the results (go to Query Preferences).</li>

        <li>GUI: when a search fails to retrieve results, the spelling
          suggestions are now presented as links inside the result list
          area. Clicking a link will replace the appropriate word inside
          the search entry.</li>

        <li>GUI: thumbnails will be displayed in the result list if
          found in the standard freedesktop thumbnails directory
          (previously created by gimp or some file manager). This Recoll
          release will not create thumbnails.</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to Copy/Paste from the term explorer
          result list.</li>

        <li>GUI: what used to be the document category filters
          (media/text/etc.) are now defined as query language
          fragments
          inside <span class="filename">mimeconf</span>. This means
          that you can redefine them freely (see the comments for the
          <tt>[guifilters]</tt> section in the
          default <span class="filename">mimeconf</span>).</li> 

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to use a Qt style sheet to modify
          many aspects of Recoll appearance. A style sheet file can be
          selected from the GUI query configuration dialog. A sample
          skeleton style sheet is to be found in the
          share/recoll/examples directory.</li>

        <li>GUI: the result list is now based on the WebKit widget
          instead of QTextBrowser. This means better HTML/CSS support,
          and even Javascript ... You can force the use the old
          QTextBrowser instead by using
          configure&nbsp;--disable-webkit. See a few CSS examples in
          the <a href="custom.html">result list customisation
            examples page</a></li>

        <li>GUI: added menu entry to show all the mime types actually
          indexed.</li>

        <li>GUI/indexing: the indexing thread has been removed. All
          indexing is now performed by a separate recollindex
          process. This has multiple advantages, the thread was just a
          very bad idea. Among others, exiting the GUI has no
          influence on an ongoing indexing.</li>

        <li>GUI/indexing: new menu entry to force a full reindex.</li>

        <li>GUI/config: the indexing configuration now only shows the
          directories customized by the user, not those which come
          from the standard configuration (ie:
          ~/.thunderbird). Showing the standard directories was more
          often confusing than useful.</li>

        <li>GUI: the default result list paragraph now displays the ipath:
          this is very useful for archive members and not too
          disturbing for other kinds.</li>

        <li>Command line query: can now select a result slice
          (first result rank and count of results). New option for
          easy parsing of results by another program.</li>

        <li>Indexing: handle the html5 <tt>charset</tt> meta tag.</li>
        <li>Indexing: added support for Okular notes and Gnumeric.</li>

        <li>Real time indexer: restart automatically when the
          configuration changes.</li>

        
        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>Indexing configuration: deleting one customized
              directory would sometimes delete the whole list (depending
              on Qt version I think).</li>
            <li>Indexing configuration: adding a customized directory
              would not make it the active/current one (so that
              another click was needed to choose it before making
              modifications).</li>
            <li>The GUI preview now performs an up to date check
              before displaying data from a subdocument, and proposes
              to reindex the container if it changed. This is mostly
              useful for mailbox containers, where preview would
              sometimes display the wrong message (if the folder had
              been compacted).</li>
            <li>Fix a bug in html charset detection. The wrong charset
              was sometimes used for GUI preview.</li>
            <li>The chm filter can now process files lacking a Topics
              node.</li>
            <li>The default slack for proximity searches from the query
            language (ie: "word1 word2"p) had become 0. It was restored to
            10.</li>
            
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
