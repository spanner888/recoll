      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.17.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.17 is fully
        compatible with 1.16 indexes, and mostly compatible with 1.15
        ones, except for a few differences for weird terms containing
        punctuation signs. Perform a full index pass if installing
        over an older version. The simplest way to do this is to quit
        all recoll programs and just delete the index directory
        (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>),
        then start recoll or
        recollindex.  <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span>
        will do the same in most cases.</p>

       <p>Also, using the anchored search feature on an 1.15 index
         requires a full reindex.</p> 


      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>Recoll 1.17 is an incremental improvements release over 1.16, no
        major function was introduced or modified.</p> 

      <ul>

        <li>When a search fails to retrieve results, the spelling
          suggestions are now presented as links inside the result list
          area. Clicking a link will replace the appropriate word inside
          the search entry.</li>
        <li>Thumbnails will be displayed in the result list if an
          appropriate one is found in the standard freedesktop
          thumbnails directory (ie: created by gimp or some file
          manager). Recoll will not create thumbnails (this would slow
          result display too much).</li>
        
        <li>The GUI now has a set of dialogs to set up the indexing
          schedule, either as automatic real time indexing started
          with the user session or as discrete cron entries. This
          will take care of the details of autostart files or crontab
          editing.</li> 
        <li>The GUI indexing thread has been removed. All indexing is
          now performed by a separate recollindex process. This has
          multiple advantages, the thread was just a very bad
          idea. Among others, exiting the GUI has no influence on an
          ongoing indexing.</li>

        <li>The GUI indexing configuration now only shows the directories
          customized by the user not those which come from the
          standard configuration (ie: ~/.thunderbird). Showing the
          standard directories was more often confusing than
          useful.</li>

        <li>It is now possible to control the date format used to
          display result (go to query preferences).</li>
        <li>It is now possible to Copy/Paste from the term explorer
          result list.</li>
        <li>Indexer: handle the html5 <tt>charset</tt> meta tag.</li>

        <li>Added okular notes and gnumeric filters.</li>

        <li>GUI: it is now possible to use a Qt style sheet to modify
          many aspects of Recoll appearance. A style sheet file can be
          selected from the GUI query configuration dialog. A sample
          skeleton style sheet is to be found in the
          share/recoll/examples directory.</li>

        <li>GUI: Added menu entry to show all the mime types actually
          indexed.</li>

        <li>Fixed bugs:
          <ul>
            <li>Indexing configuration: deleting one customized
              directory would sometimes delete the whole list (depending
              on Qt version I think).</li>
            <li>Indexing configuration: adding a customized directory
              would not make it the active/current one (so that
              another click was needed to choose it before making
              modifications).</li>
            <li>The GUI preview now performs an up to date check
              before displaying data from a subdocument, and proposes
              to reindex the container if it changed. This is mostly
              useful for mailbox containers, where preview would
              sometimes display the wrong message (if the folder had
              been compacted).</li>
            <li>Fix a bug in html charset detection. The wrong charset
              was sometimes used for GUI preview.</li>
            <li>The chm filter can now process files lacking a Topics
              node.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
