      <h1>Release notes for Recoll 1.19.x</h1>


      <h2>Caveats</h2>

      <p><em>Installing over an older version</em>: 1.19 
        </p>

      <p>Case/diacritics sensitivity is still off by default for this
        release. It can be turned on <em>only</em> by editing recoll.conf
        (<a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INDEXING.CONFIG.SENS">
          see the manual</a>). If you do so, you must then reset the index.</p>

      <p>Always reset the index if you do not know by which version it
        was created (you're not sure it's 1.18). The simplest way to
        do this is to quit all recoll programs and just delete the
        index directory
        (<span class="literal">rm&nbsp;-rf&nbsp;~/.recoll/xapiandb</span>),
        then start recoll or recollindex. <br/>
        <span class="literal">recollindex&nbsp;-z</span> &nbsp;will do
        the same in most, but not all, cases. It's better to use
        the <tt>rm</tt> method, which will also ensure that no debris
        from older releases remain (e.g.: old stemming files which are
        not used any more).</p>

      <p>Installing 1.19 over an 1.18 index will force a lot of
        reindexing anyway because Recoll switched from using st_ctime
        instead of st_mtime to detect file modifications, meaning that
        all files which were modified since created will be
        updated.</p>

      <p><span class="important">Viewer exceptions</span>: as in 1.18
        (but we kept this section for 1.17 users), 
        there is a list of mime types that should be opened with
        the locally configured application even when <em>Use
          Desktop Preferences</em> is checked. This allows making
        use of new functions (direct access to page), which could not
        be available through the desktop's <tt>xdg-open</tt>.  The
        default list contains PDF, Postscript and DVI, which should be
        opened with the <em>evince</em> (or <em>atril</em> for
        Mint/MATE users) viewer for the page access functions to
        work. If you want to keep the previous behaviour (losing the
        page number functionality), you need to prune the list after
        installation . This can be done from the <em>Preferences->Gui
        Configuration</em> menu.</p>

      <h2>Changes in Recoll 1.19.0</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>Indexing can use multiple threads. This can be a
          major performance boost for people with multiprocessor
          machines and big indexes. The threads setup is
          roughly auto-configured when recollindex starts, based on
          the number of processors, but it is also possible to taylor
          it in the configuration. Here are some
          <a href="http://www.recoll.org/idxthreads/threadingRecoll.html">
            notes about the transformation and the performance
            improvements</a>. There is also a 
          <a href="http://www.recoll.org/usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INSTALL.CONFIG.RECOLLCONF.IDXTHREADS">
            section in the manual</a> to describe the configuration.
        </li> 

        <li>There is a new result list/table popup menu option to
          display all the sub-documents for a given one. This is
          mostly useful to display the attachments to an email. The
          resulting screen can be used to save a multiple selection of
          the entries to files.</li>

        <li>It is now possible to use OR with "dir:" clauses, and
          wildcards have been enabled.</li>

        <li>When the option to follow symbolic links is not set
          -which is the default- symbolic links are now indexed as
          such (name and content).</li>

        <li>There are new GUI configuration options to run in "search
          as you type" mode (which I don't find useful at all...), and
          to disable the Qt auto-completion inside the simple search
          string. The completion was often more confusing and ennoying than
          useful, especially because it is case-insensitive when case
          sometimes matter for Recoll searches (capitalization to
          disable stemming).</li>
        
        <li>When the option to collapse identical results is used,
          documents which do have duplicates are shown with a
          link to list the clones. This function needs new data from
          the index, so it will only completely work after a full 1.19
          reindex.</li>

        <li>Recoll should now behave reasonably on video files: index
          the name and propose an Open button in the result list to
          start the configured player.</li>

        <li>Thanks to Recoll
          user <a href="https://github.com/koniu">Koniu</a>, you can now
          access your Recoll indexes through a Web 
          browser interface. The server side is based on
          the <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle Python
            Web frameork</a> and the Recoll Python module, and can run
            self-contained (no necessity to run apache or another web
            server), so it's quite simple to set up. See:
          See the <a href="https://github.com/koniu/recoll-webui/">
            Recoll WebUI project</a> on GitHub. </li>

        <li>There is a new path translation facility, with a GUI
          interface, to make it easier to share an index from a network
          share on clients on which the mount points might be
          different. This could also probably be put to use to design
          a "portable index" feature (for removable media).</li>

        <li>The first indexing run after Recoll installation (for a new
          user) will run in a fashion which will put data likely to be
          useful into the index faster, so that an impatient user can
          more quickly try searches.</li>

        <li>Implemented cache for last file uncompressed. This will
          much improve usage, e.g. for people fetching successive
          messages from a compressed mail folder.</li>

        <li>Recollindex will now change its current directory to a
          temporary one (e.g. /tmp) to mitigate the problems of some
          filters creating temporary files and not cleaning them.</li>

        <li>There is a new recursive reindex option to command line
          indexer.</li>

        <li>The default result list paragraph format has been slightly
          tweaked (removed the relevance percentage and small ordering
          and formatting changes).</li>

        <li>Mime type wildcard expansion is now performed against the
          index, not the configuration. This fixes many problems when
          searching for, e.g., media files indexed only by name.</li>

        <li>The choice for case/diacritics sensitivity is now fully
          processed during wildcard expansion (for case-sensitive
          indexes).</li> 

        <li>The Snippets popup (list of pages and excerpts typically
          produced for PDF documents) can now use an external
          CSS stylesheet. This is useful because the Qt Webkit
          objects do not fully inherit the Qt configuration so that,
          for example, a style sheet is needed for using
          a different background color. The style sheet is chosen
          from the <tt>Preferences->GUI configuration->Result
          list</tt> panel.</li> 

        <li>Improved handling of filters during indexing resulting in
          less subprocesses.</li>

        <li>Added function to import tags from external application
          (e.g. Tmsu).</li>

        <li>Changed format for rclaptg field. Was colon-separated,
          now uses normal value/attributes syntax with an empty value
          like:
          <pre>
            localfields = ; attr1 = val1 ; attr2 = val2
          </pre>
        </li>

        <li>Extended file attributes are now indexed by default. As a
          side effect, recoll now uses st_ctime, not st_mtime to detect
          file changes. This means that installing 1.19 will reindex
          many files (all those that were modified since created).
          Recoll now processes the <tt>charset</tt>
          and <tt>mime_type</tt> standardized extended attributes.</li>

        <li>The Python module has been expanded to include the
          interface for extracting data. This means that you could now
          write most of the Recoll GUI in Python if you wished. There
          is
          a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/src/5b4bd9ef26a1/src/python/samples/recollgui/qrecoll.py?at=default">bit
          of sample code</a> in the source package doing just this. A
          few incompatible changes had to be made to the Python
          module. Especially the "Query.next" field is gone and the
          module structure has been changed (different import
          statement needed). Adapting your code is trivial, have a
          look at the changes in
          the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/src/5b4bd9ef26a10912bf8bd833fe6c084bd5a7bdbd/src/desktop/unity-lens-recoll/recollscope/rclsearch.py?at=default">Unity
          Lens module</a> for an example. The new module is compatible
          with
          the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">Python
          Database API Specification v2.0</a> for the parts that make
          sense for a non-relational DB.</li>

        <li>Recoll now uses a dynamic library for the code shared by
          the query interface, the indexer and the Python
          module. This should have no visible impact but was rendered
          necessary by the Python module evolutions.</li>

        <li>And quite a few <a href="BUGS.html#b_1_18_2">Fixed bugs</a></li>

      </ul>
