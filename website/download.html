      <h2><a>General information</a></h2>

      <p>The current version is 1.17.3. <a href="release-1.17.html">
          Release notes</a>.</p>

      <p>The download page for Recoll 1.16 is
	<a href="download-1.16.html">still available</a>.</p>

      <p>Recoll <a href="usermanual/rcl.install.html">
	  Installation / building manual</a>.</p> 

      <p>The indexing filters used for some document types may need
        external packages not installed on your system by default, and
        not installed automatically with Recoll: <a
	href="features.html#doctypes"> take a look at the list</a> and
	decide what you need to
	install. Also <a href="filters/filters.html">new or updated
	filters</a> sometimes become available after a release. As a
	rule, all filters are compatible with all Recoll
	versions. Any compatibility problem will be explicitely
	mentionned.</p>

      <p>The Recoll term explorer tool in phonetic mode (marginally
	useful and optional) uses the <b>aspell</b> package, version
	0.60 (utf-8 support) or newer.</p>

      <p>If you find problems with this page, the package or its
	installation, <em>please</em> <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">
	  report them</a>.</p>

      <h4>What do the release numbers mean?</h4>

      <p>The Recoll releases are numbered X.Y.Z. The X
	would only change for really major modifications like a big
	change in the index format, and possibly won't ever reach
	2.</p> 

      <p>Y is for functional modifications. These may bring bugs, so
        if you don't need the new features, you may want to wait a little,
        and especially skip the first release (X.Y.0), at least for a few
        weeks.</p> 

      <p>Z changes for <a href="BUGS.html">bug fixes</a> only, 
	and moving from X.Y.Z to X.Y.Z+u should in general involve
	little risk of regression. But, <em>any</em> change can bring
	problems, if you are not affected by the corrected bugs (check
	the <a href="CHANGES.html">changes file</a>), there is
	probably no necessity to upgrade anyway.</p>

      <h2><a name="source">Source</a></h2>

      <h3>Current release distribution: 1.17.3:</h3> 
      <!-- Attention: source packages must remain here, not in a
        subdirectory, because of all the places they're referred from
        (package watches) -->

<!--
      <h3>Snapshot</h3>
      <p>I sometimes release a source tarfile when I consider that the
      current development version is stable enough. The current
      snapshot contains commits up to 2240 (see 
       <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/changesets">the
       changelog</a>, and a synthetic abstract in the
       current <a href="release-1.16.html">1.16 release notes</a>).

-->

      <h3>Prerequisites for building from source:</h3>
        <ul>
	 <li>C++ compiler. Its absence sometimes manifests itself by
	 strange messages about iconv_open (fixed after 1.13.04).</li>

         <li><p>Xapian core development libraries. Most Linux distributions
           carry them in their package repository. Or you will find source and
	   binary packages on the 
           <a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">
           Xapian download page</a>. <br /> 
           Recoll should still work with Xapian 1.0, but it is highly
           recommended to use a Xapian 1.2 version.</p> 

           <p><em>Note on building Xapian for older CPUs:</em> The
	     build configurations for Xapian releases 1.0.21 and
	     1.2.1 or newer enable the use of SSE2 floating point
	     instructions. These instructions are not available in CPUs
	     older than Intel Pentium&nbsp;4 or AMD Athlon&nbsp;64. When
	     building for such a CPU, you need to add the --disable-sse
	     flag to the Xapian library configure command. If this is
	     not done, the problem signals itself by "Illegal
	     instruction" crashes (SIGILL) in recollindex and recoll.
	   </p>

         </li>

        <li>X11 development files.</li>

        <li>zlib development files.</p>

        <li><p>Qt development files: Qt 4.4 or newer. The Recoll GUI
            will not build with Qt releases older than 4.4.</p></li>

        <li>Python development package: you can avoid needing this by
          configuring with --disable-python-module.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Source repository:</h3>
      <p>The <span class="application">Recoll</span> source repository is
        hosted on 
      <a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/overview">bitbucket.org</a>. 
        The trunk is usually a bit on the bleeding edge, but there is
        always a maintenance branch for the current production version.</p>

      <h2><a name="packages">Packages</a></h2>

      <p>Packages or ports for Recoll are available in the standard
        repositories for many distributions.</p>
      <p>However they are often a bit older or built with older Xapian 
        releases. Here follow a number of updated packages and
        instructions for a number of distributions.</p>
      <p>All binary packages on this page need a Qt 4 (4.4 at least) runtime
	environment. To make things easier, on systems where Xapian is
	not available from the standard package repositories, the
	Recoll package will have a static link to Xapian so that you
	do not need to build/install it separately.</p>

      <h3><a name="debian">Debian</a></h3>

      <p>The Debian Recoll packages are usually fairly up to date (at
        least in testing), just use the appropriate Debian repository.</p>

      <h3><a name="ubuntu">Ubuntu</a></h3>

        <p>There are Personal Package Archives on launchpad.net for 
          <a  href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">
            Recoll, kio-recoll and recoll-lens</a>. These were built from the
          latest versions, for a set of Ubuntu series. starting at
          Lucid. The installation is very simple:
          <pre><tt>
          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:recoll-backports/recoll-1.15-on
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install recoll
          </tt></pre>


        <h3><a name="mint">Linux Mint</a></h3>
        <p>The Ubuntu PPA works perfectly for Mint 13 (and probably
          other releases too). Just follow the instructions for Ubuntu.</p>
        
      <h3>RPMS</h3> 

       <p>Some Fedora and Mandriva packages unfortunately think that they
	depend on exiftool (which is needed by the little used jpeg
	info filter), due to excessive rpmbuild	cleverness.
	<br>You'll need to install the Xapian, Qt, and zlib development
	  packages if you want use the source rpms.</i></p>
	  
      <h3>Fedora</h3>
      <p>Recoll is present in the standard Fedora package
	repositories starting from F-12. The new versions are tracked quite
	closely, so I don't build the rpms any more (email me if you need
	one).</p> 

      <h3>OpenSUSE</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Recoll is in the KDE:Extra repository

<!--
I now use the OpenSUSE build service to create Recoll OpenSUSE packages. 
-->
        You just need to add the repository to your
        software sources (Yast2->software->Software repositories).<br>
        <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Extra/">
          Repository list (supported Suse versions)</a>. After adding the
          appropriate repository to your software sources, you will be
          able to install recoll and kio_recoll from the software
          management interface. The Xapian dependancy will also be
          satisfied from the build service repository. Some of the older
          repositories do not build antiword, just tell the software manager
          to "break" recoll by installing anyway, and get antiword
          somewhere else.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Mandriva</h3>
      <blockquote>

        <p>Mandriva linux 2011 using Qt 4 and the Xapian version
             from the Mandriva repository.: 
	  <a href="mandriva2011/recoll-1.17.2-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm">
	    recoll-1.17.2-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm</a>, 
          <a href="recoll-debug-1.17.2-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm">
            recoll-debug-1.17.2-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm</a>. <br>
	  Source: 
	<a href="mandriva2011/recoll-1.17.2-1.src.rpm">
	  recoll-1.17.2-1.src.rpm</a>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2><a name="ports">Ports</a></h2> 

      <h3>Mac port</h3>

      <p>It seems that Recoll will sometimes find data that Spotlight
        misses (especially inside pdfs apparently, which is probably
        more to the credit of poppler than recoll itself).</p>
      <p>Recoll is in MacPorts and really easy to install:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/InstallingMacPorts">
            Install MacPorts</a>.</li>
        <li>Type "sudo port install recoll"</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Recoll is then available from the command line and as an icon in
        the usual MacPorts applications place.</p>

      <h2>Building on Solaris</h2>
      <p>I did not test building the GUI on Solaris for this version. You
          will need at least Qt 4.4. The old hints
          in <a href="download-1.14.html">the previous page</a> may
          still be valid.</p>
        <p>Someone did test the indexer and Python module build, they
          do work, with a few minor glitches. Be sure to use
          GNU <b>make</b> and <b>install</b>.</p>

      <h2><a name="translations">Translations</a></h2>

      <p>Most of the translations for 1.17 are incomplete
	The source translation files are included in the source
	release. If your language has some english messages left and
	you want to take a shot at fixing the problem, you can send
	the results to <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">me</a> and earn
	my gratefulness (and your less multilingual
	compatriot's)...</p>

      <p>You can use the <em>.ts</em> file to alter the translations if you
	wish (use Qt's <em>linguist</em> tool to edit the source file,
	then <em>lrelease</em> to produce the <em>.qm</em> file.).
	The <literal>.qm</literal> file should be copied to 
	<span class="filename">/usr/[local/]share/recoll/translations</span>
      </p>

      <p><a href="translations/recoll_xx.ts">recoll_xx.ts</a> is a blank
	Recoll 1.17 message file, handy to work on a new translation.</p>

      <h3>Updated 1.17 translations that became available after the
	release:</h3>

      <p>Note that, if you are running an older release,
        you may find updated messages by looking inside the
        appropriate maintenance branch
        on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/src">bitbucket</a>.</p>
