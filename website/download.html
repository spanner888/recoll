<h2><a name="general">General information</a></h2>

<p>The current version is 1.19.14. <a href="release-1.19.html">Release
notes</a>.</p>

<p>The download page for Recoll 1.18 is <a href="download-1.18.html">still
available</a>.</p>

<p>Recoll <a href="usermanual/RCL.INSTALL.html">Installation / building
manual</a>.</p>

<p>The indexing filters used for some document types may need external
packages not installed on your system by default, and not installed
automatically with Recoll: <a href="features.html#doctypes">take a
look at the list</a> and decide what you need to install.</p>

<p>The Recoll term explorer tool in phonetic mode (marginally useful and
optional) uses the <b>aspell</b> package, version 0.60 (utf-8 support) or
newer.</p>

<p>If you find problems with this page, the package or its installation,
<em>please</em> <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">report them</a>.</p>

<h4>What do the release numbers mean?</h4>

<p>The Recoll releases are numbered X.Y.Z. The X would only change for really
major modifications like a big change in the index format, and possibly won't
ever reach 2.</p>

<p>Y is for functional modifications. These may bring bugs, so if you don't
need the new features, you may want to wait a little, and especially skip the
first release (X.Y.0), at least for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Z changes for <a href="BUGS.html">bug fixes</a> only, and moving from X.Y.Z
to X.Y.Z+u should in general involve little risk of regression. But,
<em>any</em> change can bring problems, if you are not affected by the
corrected bugs (check the <a href="release-1.19.html">release file</a>), there
is probably no necessity to upgrade anyway.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites for building from source:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>C++ compiler. Its absence sometimes manifests itself by strange messages
    about iconv_open (fixed after 1.13.04).</li>
  <li><p>Xapian core development libraries. Most Linux distributions carry them
    in their package repository. Or you will find source and binary packages on
    the <a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">Xapian download page</a>.
    <br>
    Recoll should still work with Xapian 1.0, but it is highly recommended to
    use a Xapian 1.2 version.</p>
    <p><em>Note on building Xapian for older CPUs:</em> The build
    configurations for Xapian releases 1.0.21 and 1.2.1 or newer enable the use
    of SSE2 floating point instructions. These instructions are not available
    in CPUs older than Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64. When building for such
    a CPU, you need to add the --disable-sse flag to the Xapian library
    configure command. If this is not done, the problem signals itself by
    "Illegal instruction" crashes (SIGILL) in recollindex and recoll. </p>
  </li>
  <li>X11 development files.</li>
  <li>zlib development files.</li>
  <li><p>Qt development files: Qt 4.4 or newer. The Recoll GUI will not build
    with Qt releases older than 4.4.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Qt webkit development: Qt WebKit is quite often distributed apart from
    the main Qt lib. It is possible to configure Recoll not to use Qt WebKit
    (see configure --help).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Python development package: you can avoid needing this by configuring
    with --disable-python-module.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Source repository:</h3>

<p>The <span class="application">Recoll</span> source repository is hosted on
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/medoc/recoll/overview">bitbucket.org</a>. The
trunk is usually a bit on the bleeding edge, but there is always a maintenance
branch for the current production version.</p>

<h3>Instructions for building</h3>

<p>Normally, it's just <tt>configure; make; make install</tt>. If a bit
  more detail is needed, 
  <a href="http://www.recoll.org/usermanual/RCL.INSTALL.BUILDING.html">
    there is some in the manual</a>.

<h3>Older recoll releases:</h3>

<p>
<a href="recoll-1.19.13.tar.gz">1.19.13</a>. 
<a href="recoll-1.19.12p1.tar.gz">1.19.12p1</a>. 
<a href="recoll-1.19.9.tar.gz">1.19.9</a>. 
<a href="recoll-1.18.2.tar.gz">1.18.2</a>. 
<a href="recoll-1.17.3.tar.gz">1.17.3</a>. 
</p>

<div id="packages">
<h2><a name="packages">Packages</a></h2>

<p>Packages or ports for Recoll are available in the standard repositories for
many distributions.</p>

<p>However they are often a bit older or built with older Xapian releases. Here
  follow some pointers to find newer packages for some
  distributions. In most cases, you will just need to use an
  alternate repository.</p>

<p>I sometimes build binary packages when no appropriate repository
  exists. Any binary package directly linked from this page need a Qt
  4 (4.4 at least) runtime environment. To make things easier, on
  systems where Xapian is not available from the standard package
  repositories, the Recoll package will have a static link to Xapian
  so that you do not need to build/install it separately.</p>

<h3><a name="debian">Debian</a></h3>

<p>The Debian Recoll packages are usually fairly up to date (at least in
testing), just use the appropriate Debian repository.</p>

<p><i>Except they're not at the moment (2014-05)...</i>. So here are
1.19.14 packages for Debian stable (Wheezy)
<a href="debian-stable/recoll_1.19.14-1_amd64.deb">amd64</a> 
and <a href="debian-stable/recoll_1.19.14-1_i386.deb">i386</a>. 
You can list the <a href="debian-stable">directory</a> for the 
source package and other files (e.g. python-recoll .deb).</p>

<h3><a name="ubuntu">Ubuntu</a></h3>

<p>There are Personal Package Archives on launchpad.net for <a
href="https://launchpad.net/~recoll-backports/+archive/recoll-1.15-on">Recoll,
kio-recoll and recoll-lens</a>. These were built from the latest versions, for
a set of Ubuntu series. starting at Lucid. The installation is very simple: </p>
<pre><tt>
          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:recoll-backports/recoll-1.15-on
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install recoll
</tt></pre>

<p>The 1.19 packages in the PPA now have a separate package
  for the Python extension, like the standard ones, so there should be
  no more conflict issues while switching from the PPA to the normal
  repositories and back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>Notes for Ubuntu Lucid</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If you still use Ubuntu 10.04 (<em>Lucid</em>), you will need
      to add the <a
      href="https://launchpad.net/~xapian-backports/+archive/xapian-1.2">Xapian
      backports PPA</a> to provide the <tt>libxapian22</tt> package</li>
    <li>The <tt><code>rclepub</code></tt> filter apparently needs <tt>Python
      2.7</tt>. You will need to install it and modify the first line of the
      filter script to execute <tt>python2.7</tt> instead of
    <tt>python</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="mint">Linux Mint</a></h3>

<p>The Ubuntu PPA works perfectly for Mint 13 (and probably other releases
too). Just follow the instructions for Ubuntu.</p>

<h3>RPMS</h3>

<p>You'll need to install the Xapian, Qt, Qt-Webkit and zlib development
packages if you want use the source rpms.</p>

<h3>Fedora</h3>

<p>Recoll is present in the standard Fedora package repositories starting from
F-12. The new versions are tracked quite closely, so I don't build the rpms any
more (email me if you need one).</p>

<h3>OpenSUSE</h3>

<p>Recoll is in the KDE:Extra repository. You just need to add the
  repository to your software
  sources (Yast2-&gt;software-&gt;Software repositories).<br>
  <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Extra/">
    Repository list (supported Suse versions)</a>. 
  After adding the appropriate repository to your software sources,
  you will be able to install recoll and kio_recoll from the software
  management interface. The Xapian dependancy will also be satisfied
  from the build service repository. Some of the older repositories do
  not build antiword, just tell the software manager to "break" recoll
  by installing anyway, and get antiword somewhere else.</p>

<h3>Mageia</h3>

<p>Mageia version 2: <a
  href="mageia2/recoll-1.18.1-1.mga2.i586.rpm">mageia2/recoll-1.18.1-1.mga2.i586.rpm,

<div id="ports">
<h2><a name="ports">Ports</a></h2>

<h3>Mac port</h3>

<p>It seems that Recoll will sometimes find data that Spotlight misses
(especially inside pdfs apparently, which is probably more to the credit of
poppler than recoll itself).</p>

<p>Recoll is in MacPorts and really easy to install:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/InstallingMacPorts">Install
    MacPorts</a>.</li>
  <li>Type "sudo port install recoll"</li>
</ol>

<p>Recoll is then available from the command line and as an icon in the usual
MacPorts applications place.</p>
</div>

<div id="filters">
  <h2><a name="filters">Updated filters</a></h2>
  <p><a href="filters/filters.html">new or updated filters</a>
      sometimes become available after a release. As a rule, all
      filters are compatible with all Recoll versions. Any
      compatibility problem will be explicitely mentionned.</p>
</div>

<div id="translations">
<h2><a name="translations">Translations</a></h2>

<p>Most of the translations for 1.19 are incomplete The source translation
files are included in the source release. If your language has some english
messages left and you want to take a shot at fixing the problem, you can send
the results to <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">me</a> and earn my gratefulness
(and your less multilingual compatriot's)...</p>

<p>You can use the <em>.ts</em> file to alter the translations if you wish (use
Qt's <em>linguist</em> tool to edit the source file, then <em>lrelease</em> to
produce the <em>.qm</em> file.). The <literal>.qm</literal>file should be
copied to <span class="filename">/usr/[local/]share/recoll/translations</span>
</p>

<p><a href="translations/recoll_xx.ts">recoll_xx.ts</a> is a blank Recoll 1.19
message file, handy to work on a new translation.</p>

<h3>Updated 1.19 translations that became available after the release:</h3>

<p>A Polish translation by Tymoteusz:
<a href="translations/recoll_pl.ts">recoll_pl.ts</a>
