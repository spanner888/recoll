Description: a personal full text search package with a QT GUI
 The Recoll personal full text search package is based on a very strong 
 backend (Xapian), for which it provides an easy to use and feature-rich 
 interface.
 .
 Features:
    * QT-based GUI.
    * Supports the following document types (and their compressed versions): 
      - Natively: text, html, OpenOffice files, maildir and mailbox 
        (Mozilla and Thunderbird mail ok) with attachments, gaim log files.
      - With external helpers:  pdf (pdftotext), postscript (ghostscript),
        msword (antiword), excel, ppt (catdoc), rtf (unrtf), 
    * Powerful query facilities, with boolean searches, phrases, filter on
      file types and directory tree. 
    * Support for multiple charsets. Internal processing and storage uses
      Unicode UTF-8. 
    * Stemming performed at query time (can switch stemming language after
      indexing) 
    * Easy installation. No database daemon, web server or exotic language
      necessary. 
    * An indexer which runs either as a thread inside the GUI or as an
      external, cron'able program.
