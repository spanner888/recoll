Sample Unity scope Daemon written in Python
-------------------------------------------

Dependencies
------------

gir1.2-unity-5.0
gir1.2-dee-1.0
recoll

Trying out the scope
--------------------

You can install the scope like this:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr

Then run the daemon with:

  ./unity_recoll_daemon.py

And from another terminal restart Unity like this:

  setsid unity

[the setsid ^^ is a small trick to detach the unity process from the terminal
 so you can close it if you want. A bit like 'unity &' just better ;-) ]

Past this step you can freely Control-C the scope daemon to stop it,
do some changes, and restart it. No need to restart Unity, it will find
the newly started daemon automatically.

Getting rid of the scope
------------------------

Just remove the gdrive.scope file. For example, by issuing:

  sudo rm /usr/share/unity/scopes/files/recoll.scope

With that done, restart Unity once again with 'setsid unity' and all should
be back to normal.
