Hello, I was going to call because of an online debit card payment issue,
but I just saw that my card was being reissued and that the address on the
account was wrong. So the first thing would be to check that you did not
send a card to the wrong address.


I'll change my address on the site then (it's the previous address on the
account, this was a temporary change).

The original issue was that I tried to pay with my debit card on a web site
and the transaction failed because it was using 3D Secure and it requested
the last 4 numbers of my social security number.

As I am not living in the USA, I have no US social security number, and I
don't know what you have on file for me for this value.

Anyway I would like to find a solution to pay online. Either set up some
other kind or number, or any solution that you may be able to suggest.
