# (C) 2015 J.F.Dockes

# This file contains most of the data which determines how we
# handle the different mime types (also see the "mimeview" file).
#
# This is the version specific to MS-WINDOWS
#
# Sections:
# top-level: Decompression parameters. Should not be at top-level, historical.
# [index] : Associations of mime types to the filters that translate them
#      to plain text or html.
# [icons] : Associations of mime types to result list icons (GUI)
# [categories] : groupings of mime types (media, text, message etc.)
# [guifilters] : defines the filtering checkboxes in the GUI. Uses the
#   above categories by default

## #######################################
# Decompression: these types need a first pass to create a temp file to
# work with. We use a script because uncompress utilities usually work in
# place, which is not suitable. 
#
# Obviously this should be in a [decompress] section or such, but it was once
# forgotten and remained global for compatibility...
#
# The %t parameter will be substituted to the name of a temporary directory
# by recoll. This directory is guaranteed empty when calling the filter
#
# The %f parameter will be substituted with the input file. 
#
# The script (ie: rcluncomp) must output the uncompressed file name on
# stdout. Note that the windows version will always use 7z, and ignore
# the decompressor parameter in the following lines
application/gzip  =  uncompress python rcluncomp.py 7z %f %t
application/x-gzip  =  uncompress python rcluncomp.py 7z %f %t
application/x-compress = uncompress python rcluncomp.py 7z %f %t

application/x-xz = uncompress python rcluncomp.py 7z %f %t

# Filters for indexing and internal preview. 
# The "internal" filters are hardwired in the c++ code.
# The external "exec" filters are typically scripts. By default, they output the
# document in simple html format, have a look at the scripts.
# A different format (ie text/plain), and a character set can be defined for
# each filter, see the exemples below (ie: msword)

# This defines the top level filters in the GUI (accessed by the the
# radiobuttons above the results area, or a toolbar combobox).
# Each entry defines a label and a query language fragment that will be
# applied to filter the current query if the option is activated.
#
# This does not really belong in mimeconf, but it does belong in the index
# config (not the GUI one), because it's not necessarily the same in all
# configs, it has to go somewhere, and it's not worth a separate config
# file...
#
# By default this filters by document category (see above), but any
# language fragment should be ok. Be aware though that the "document
# history" queries only know about simple "rclcat" filtering.
#
# If you don't want the filter names to be displayed in alphabetic order,
# you can define them with a colon. The part before the colon is not
# displayed but used for ordering, ie: a:zzbutshouldbefirst b:aacomeslast
